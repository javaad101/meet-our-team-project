<p align="CENTER"><b>PROMISSORY NOTE</b></p>

<p>Principal Amount: Up to $500,000</p>
<p align="RIGHT">Dated as of August 30, 2021</p>

<p>Fortune Joy International Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the <b>“Maker”</b>), promises to pay to the order of Fortune Joy Capital Corp. or its registered assigns or successors in interest (the <b>“Payee”</b>)
 the principal sum of up to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in 
lawful money of the United States of America, on the terms and 
conditions described below. All payments on this Note shall be made by 
check or wire transfer of immediately available funds or as otherwise 
determined by the Maker to such account as the Payee may from time to 
time designate by written notice in accordance with the provisions of 
this Note.</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Principal.</b> The principal balance of this Promissory Note (this <b>“Note”</b>)
 shall be such amount equal to the aggregate provided by the Drawdown 
Request (as defined below). It shall be payable promptly after the date 
on which the Maker consummates an initial public offering of its 
securities or the date on which the Company determines not to conduct an
 initial public offering of its securities. The principal balance may be
 prepaid at any time. Under no circumstances shall any individual, 
including but not limited to any officer, director, employee or 
shareholder of the Maker, be obligated personally for any obligations or
 liabilities of the Maker hereunder.</li>
    <li><b>Interest.</b> No interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of this Note.</li>
    <li><b>Drawdown Requests.</b> Maker and Payee agree that Maker may 
request up to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) for costs 
reasonably related to Maker’s initial public offering of its securities.
 The principal of this Note may be drawn down from time to time prior to
 the earlier of (i) the date on which the Maker consummates an initial 
public offering of its securities or (ii) the date on which the Company 
determines not to conduct an initial public offering of its securities, 
upon written request from Maker to Payee (each, a “Drawdown Request”). 
Each Drawdown Request must state the amount to be drawn down. Payee 
shall fund each Drawdown Request no later than five (5) business days 
after receipt of a Drawdown Request; provided, however, that the maximum
 amount of drawdowns collectively under this Note is Five Hundred 
Thousand Dollars ($500,000). Once an amount is drawn down under this 
Note, it shall not be available for future Drawdown Requests even if 
prepaid. No fees, payments or other amounts shall be due to Payee in 
connection with, or as a result of, any Drawdown Request by Maker. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments shall be applied first to 
payment in full of any costs incurred in the collection of any sum due 
under this Note, including (without limitation) reasonable attorneys’ 
fees, and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of this 
Note.</li>
    <li><b>Application of Payments.</b> All payments shall be applied 
first to payment in full of any costs incurred in the collection of any 
sum due under this Note, including (without limitation) reasonable 
attorney’s fees, then to the payment in full of any late charges and 
finally to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance of this Note.</li>
