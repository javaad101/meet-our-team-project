        <h3>Compensation Committee</h3>
        <p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish a compensation committee of the board of directors. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi are independent and Michael Davidov chairs the compensation committee.</p>
        <p>We will adopt a compensation committee charter, which will detail the purpose and responsibility of the compensation committee, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;</li>
            <li>reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to the compensation and any incentive-compensation and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval of all of our other officers;</li>
            <li>reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;</li>
            <li>implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;</li>
            <li>assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;</li>
            <li>approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;</li>
            <li>producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and</li>
            <li>reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The charter will also provide that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.</p>
