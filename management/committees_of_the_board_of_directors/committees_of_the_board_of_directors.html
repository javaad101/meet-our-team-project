        <h2>Committees of the Board of Directors</h2>
        <p>Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules we will establish two standing committees â€” an audit committee in compliance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors.</p>
