        <h3>Audit Committee</h3>
        <p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will serve as members of our audit committee, and Kevin Vassily will chair the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. We believe that each of Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.</p>
        <p>Each member of the audit committee is or will be financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Kevin Vassily qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules and has accounting or related financial management expertise.</p>
        <p>We will adopt an audit committee charter, which will detail the purpose and principal functions of the audit committee, including:</p>
