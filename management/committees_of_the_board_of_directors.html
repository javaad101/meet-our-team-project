        <h2>Committees of the Board of Directors</h2>
        <p>Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules we will establish two standing committees — an audit committee in compliance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors.</p>

        <h3>Audit Committee</h3>
        <p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will serve as members of our audit committee, and Kevin Vassily will chair the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. We believe that each of Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.</p>
        <p>Each member of the audit committee is or will be financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Kevin Vassily qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules and has accounting or related financial management expertise.</p>
        <p>We will adopt an audit committee charter, which will detail the purpose and principal functions of the audit committee, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>assisting board oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our independent auditor’s qualifications and independence and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors;</li>
            <li>the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;</li>
            <li>pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;</li>

            <li>reviewing with management, the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compensation Committee</h3>
        <p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish a compensation committee of the board of directors. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi are independent and Michael Davidov chairs the compensation committee.</p>
        <p>We will adopt a compensation committee charter, which will detail the purpose and responsibility of the compensation committee, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;</li>
            <li>reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to the compensation and any incentive-compensation and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval of all of our other officers;</li>
            <li>reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;</li>
            <li>implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;</li>

            <li>approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;</li>
            <li>producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and</li>
            <li>reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The charter will also provide that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.</p>
