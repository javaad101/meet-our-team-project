        <h2>Conflicts of Interest</h2>
        <p>All of our executive officers and certain of our directors have or may have fiduciary and contractual duties to certain companies in which they have invested. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing it. However, we do not expect these duties to present a significant conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination.</p>
        <p>Under Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company;</li>
            <li>duty not to make a profit based on their positions as director (unless the company permits them to do so); and</li>
            <li>duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.</p>
        <p>Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our memorandum and articles of association will provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.</p>
        <p>Members of our management team may become an officer or director of another special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act even before we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.</li>
            <li>In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.</li>
            <li>Our initial shareholders purchased founder shares prior to the date of this prospectus and our sponsors will purchase the insider units in transactions that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their right to liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our initial shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the insider units will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the insider units will expire worthless. The initial shareholders agreed that the founder shares will not be transferred, assigned, or sold until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing six months from the date of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the insider units (including the warrants thereunder) will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our initial shareholders until after the completion of our initial business combination.</li>
            <li>Affiliates of our sponsor engage in a broad spectrum of activities including principal investing, specialized investment vehicle management, asset management, financial advisory, investment research, lending and other activities. In the ordinary course of business, they engage in activities where their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with our interests. Accordingly, there may be situations in which our sponsor or its affiliates has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests. You should assume that these conflicts will not be resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain acquisition opportunities or otherwise disadvantaged in certain situations by our relationship to our sponsor and its affiliates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Affiliates of our sponsor and their clients make investments in a variety of different businesses and may directly compete with us for acquisition opportunities provided or created by affiliates of our sponsor that meet our initial business combination objectives. Our sponsor and its affiliates are under no specific obligation to offer potential acquisition opportunities to us and may allocate them at its discretion to us or other parties. We will not have any priority in respect of acquisition opportunities provided or created by our sponsor or its affiliates. You should assume that our sponsor and its affiliates and clients will have priority over us in terms of access to acquisition opportunities.</p>
        <p>A description of the specific potential conflicts for our officers and directors is contained in the table below, which summarizes the companies to which our officers and directors owe fiduciary duties or have contractual obligations that might conflict with their fiduciary duties to us.</p>
