        <h2>Number, Terms of Office and Appointment of Officers and Directors</h2>
        <p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we expect that our board of directors will consist of 5 members. The term of office will expire at our first annual general meeting. We may not hold an annual general meeting until after we consummate our initial business combination (unless required by Nasdaq).</p>
        <p>Subject to any other special rights applicable to the shareholders, any vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and voting at the meeting of our board or by a majority of the holders of our ordinary shares (or, prior to our initial business combination, holders of our founder shares).</p>
        <p>Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our memorandum and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief Operating Officer, a Chief Financial Officer, Vice Presidents, a Secretary, Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.</p>
