        <h2>Officer and Director Compensation</h2>
        <p>None of our officers or directors have received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We have agreed to pay a monthly salary of $2,500 to our chief financial officer, Xingyun (Tracy) Xu, commencing upon effectiveness of our registration statement. We have also agreed to issue 20,000 private placement units from our sponsor to each of our director nominees, Michael Davidov, Kevin Dean Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi, upon closing of the initial public offering, with 50% of the units vested immediately and 50% of the units vested upon closing of our initial business combination.</p>
        <p>We will pay our sponsor up to $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or any of their affiliates.</p>
        <p>After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other compensation from the combined company. All compensation will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers after the completion of our initial business combination will be determined by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors.</p>
        <p>We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements may influence our managementâ€™s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business, and we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination should be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination.</p>

        <h2>Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation</h2>
        <p>None of our officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more officers serving on our board of directors.</p>
