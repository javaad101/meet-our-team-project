</p>
<p>Kevin Vassily</p>
<p>
Mr. Vassily will serve as our Director upon the effectiveness of our registration 
statement on Form S-1, of which this prospectus forms a part. Mr. Vassily has 
extensive working experience as a senior management team member serving for

Ms. Shi received a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of California at Irvine, in 2003.
</p>
<p>We believe that Ms. Shi qualifies as our director because of her experience in
financial management and accounting.
</p>
<p class="H2">
Number, Terms of Office and Appointment of Officers and Directors
</p>
<p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus
forms a part, we expect that our board of directors will consist of 5 members.
The term of office will expire at our first annual general meeting. We may not
hold an annual general meeting until after we consummate our initial business
combination (unless required by Nasdaq).
</p>
<p>Subject to any other special rights applicable to the shareholders, any
vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors present and voting at the meeting of our board or by a
majority of the holders of our ordinary shares (or, prior to our initial
business combination, holders of our founder shares).
</p>
<p>Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion
of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board
of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our
memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our memorandum
and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman,
a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief Operating Officer, a Chief
Financial Officer, Vice Presidents, a Secretary, Assistant Secretaries, a
Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.
</p>
<p class="H2">Director Independence</p>
<p>Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be
independent within one year of our initial public offering. An “independent
director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of
the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with
the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the
responsibilities of a director. We expect that our board of directors will
determine that each of Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi is
an “independent director” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and
applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled
meetings at which only independent directors are present.
</p>
<p class="H2">
Officer and Director Compensation
</p>
<p>
None of our officers or directors have received any cash compensation for
services rendered to us. We have agreed to pay a monthly salary of $2,500 to our
chief financial officer, Xingyun (Tracy) Xu, commencing upon effectiveness of
our registration statement. We have also agreed to issue 20,000 private
placement units from our sponsor to each of our director nominees, Michael
Davidov, Kevin Dean Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi, upon closing of the initial
public offering, with 50% of the units vested immediately and 50% of the units
vested upon closing of our initial business combination.
</p>
<p>We will pay our sponsor up to $10,000 per month for office space, administrative
and support services. Our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their
respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our
audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to
our sponsor, officers, directors or our or any of their affiliates.
</p>
<p>After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members
of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or
other compensation from the combined company. All compensation will be fully
disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer
materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in
connection with a proposed business combination. It is unlikely the amount of
such compensation will be known at the time, because the directors of the
post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer
and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers after
the completion of our initial business combination will be determined by a
compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors.
</p>
<p>We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors
that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. The existence or terms
of any such employment or consulting arrangements may influence our management’s
motivation in identifying or selecting a target business, and we do not believe
that the ability of our management to remain with us after the completion of our
initial business combination should be a determining factor in our decision to
proceed with any potential business combination.
</p>

<p class="H2">Committees of the Board of Directors</p>
<p>Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules we will establish two standing committees — an
audit committee in compliance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act and a
compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be
comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the
compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors.
</p>
<p class="H2">Audit Committee</p>
<p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus
forms a part, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors.
Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will serve as members of
our audit committee, and Kevin Vassily will chair the audit committee. Under the
Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at
least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. We
believe that each of Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will
meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under
Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.
</p>
<p>
Each member of the audit committee is or will be financially literate and our
board of directors has determined that Kevin Vassily qualifies as an “audit
committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules and has
accounting or related financial management expertise.
</p>
<p>We will adopt an audit committee charter, which will detail the purpose and
principal functions of the audit committee, including:
<ul>
<li>
assisting board oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our independent auditor’s qualifications and independence and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors;</li>
<li>
the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;</li>
<li>
pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;</li>
<li>
reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;</li>
<li>
setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditors;
</li>
<li>
setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
</li>
<li>
obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent
auditors describing (1) the independent auditor’s internal quality-control
procedures and (2) any material issues raised by the most recent internal
quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry
or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the 
preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out 
by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;
</li>
<li>
meeting to review and discuss our annual audited financial statements and
quarterly financial statements with management and the independent auditor,
including reviewing our specific disclosures under “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”;
</li>
<li>
reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and
</li>
<li>reviewing with management, the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as
appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any
correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee
complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our
financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in
accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
</li>
</ul>    	
</p>

<p class="H2">
Compensation Committee

</p>
<p>Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus
forms a part, we will establish a compensation committee of the board of
directors. Michael Davidov, Kevin Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi will serve as
members of our compensation committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and
applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the
compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. Michael Davidov, Kevin
Vassily and Yiru (Melody) Shi are independent and Michael Davidov chairs the
compensation committee.
</p>
<p>We will adopt a compensation committee charter, which will detail the purpose
and responsibility of the compensation committee, including:
</li><li>
reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives
relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, evaluating our Chief
Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and
determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive
Officer based on such evaluation;
</li><li>
reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to
the compensation and any incentive-compensation

and equity-based

plans that are subject to board approval of all of our other officers;
</li><li>
reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;
</li><li>
implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based

remuneration plans;
</li><li>
assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report
disclosure requirements;
</li><li>
approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special
compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;
</li><li>
producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy
statement; and
</li><li>
reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the
remuneration for directors.
</p>
<p>The charter will also provide that the compensation committee may, in its sole
discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
independent legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for
the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser.
However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant,
external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will
consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required
by Nasdaq and the SEC.
</p>

<p class="H2">
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

</p>
<p>None of our officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a
member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more officers
serving on our board of directors.
</p>
<p class="H2">
Code of Ethics

</p>
<p>Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part, we will have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our
directors, officers and employees. Our Code of Ethics will be available on our
website upon the completion of this offering. Our Code of Ethics is a “code of
ethics,” as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K

. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or
waivers of, provisions of our Code of Ethics on our website.
</p>
<p class="H2">
Conflicts of Interest

</p>
<p>All of our executive officers and certain of our directors have or may have
fiduciary and contractual duties to certain companies in which they have
invested. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If
these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from
pursuing it. However, we do not expect these duties to present a significant
conflict of interest with our search for an initial business combination.
</p>
<p>Under Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary
duties:
</li><li>
duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company;
</li><li>
duty not to make a profit based on their positions as director (unless the
company permits them to do so); and
</li><li>
duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between
their duty to the company and their personal interests.
</p>
<p>As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of
conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing

, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some
instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or
authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure
by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by
shareholder approval at general meetings.
</p>
<p>Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our
directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual
obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or
will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity.
Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity
which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or
contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or
contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity,
and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our memorandum
and articles of association will provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary
duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is
expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or
officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and
contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to
pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual
obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability
to complete our business combination.
</p>

<p>Members of our management team may become an officer or director of another
special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under
the Exchange Act even before we have entered into a definitive agreement
regarding our initial business combination. Potential investors should also be
aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:
</li><li>
None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to
our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his
or her time among various business activities.
</li><li>
In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may
become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate
for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are
affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to
which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
</li><li>
Our initial shareholders purchased founder shares prior to the date of this
prospectus and our sponsors will purchase the insider units in transactions that
will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our initial
shareholders have agreed to waive their right to liquidating distributions with
respect to its founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business
combination within the completion window. However, if our initial shareholders
acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail
to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period.
If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable
time period, the proceeds of the sale of the insider units will be used to fund
the redemption of our public shares, and the insider units will expire
worthless. The initial shareholders agreed that the founder shares will not be
transferred, assigned, or sold until the earlier of (i) one year after the date
of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on
which the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50
per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations
and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading

day period commencing six months from the date of our initial business
combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business
combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, share exchange or
other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the
right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other
property. With certain limited exceptions, the insider units (including the
warrants thereunder) will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our
initial shareholders until after the completion of our initial business
combination.
</li><li>
Affiliates of our sponsor engage in a broad spectrum of activities including
principal investing, specialized investment vehicle management, asset
management, financial advisory, investment research, lending and other
activities. In the ordinary course of business, they engage in activities where
their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with our
interests. Accordingly, there may be situations in which our sponsor or its
affiliates has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially
conflicts with our interests. You should assume that these conflicts will not be
resolved in our favor and, as a result, we may be denied certain acquisition
opportunities or otherwise disadvantaged in certain situations by our
relationship to our sponsor and its affiliates.
</p>
<p>Affiliates of our sponsor and their clients make investments in a variety of
different businesses and may directly compete with us for acquisition
opportunities provided or created by affiliates of our sponsor that meet our
initial business combination objectives. Our sponsor and its affiliates are
under no specific obligation to offer potential acquisition opportunities to us
and may allocate them at its discretion to us or other parties. We will not have
any priority in respect of acquisition opportunities provided or created by our
sponsor or its affiliates. You should assume that our sponsor and its affiliates
and clients will have priority over us in terms of access to acquisition
opportunities.
</p>
<p>A description of the specific potential conflicts for our officers and directors
is contained in the table below, which summarizes the companies to which our
officers and directors owe fiduciary duties or have contractual obligations that

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above-mentioned

conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. In the event that we submit our
initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our sponsor

and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or

Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors

</p>
<p>Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and
articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and
directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman
Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide
indemnification against willful default, fraud or the consequences of committing
a crime. Our memorandum and articles of association provide for indemnification
of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including
for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own
actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect.
</p>
<p>We may purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that
insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or
payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our
obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. We also intend to enter
into indemnity agreements with them.
</p>
<p>Our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or
claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to
waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will
not seek recourse against the trust account
</p>

<p>for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only
be able to be satisfied by us if we (i) have sufficient funds outside of the
trust account or (ii) consummate an initial business combination. Furthermore, a
shareholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the
costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors
pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
</p>
<p>We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are
necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.
</p>
<p>Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may
be permitted to directors and officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the
foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
is therefore unenforceable.
