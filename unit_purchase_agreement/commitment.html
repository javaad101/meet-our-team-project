<p>The undersigned hereby commits to purchase an aggregate of 465,000 
units of the Company (“Initial Units”) at $10.00 per Initial Unit for an
 aggregate purchase price of $4,650,000 (the “Initial Purchase Price”). 
Additionally, if the underwriters in the IPO exercise their 
over-allotment option in full or part, the undersigned further commits 
to purchase up to an additional 45,000 Units (“Additional Units” and 
together with the Initial Units, the “Private Units”) at $10.00 per 
Additional Unit for an aggregate purchase price of up to $450,000 (the 
“Over-Allotment Purchase Price” and together with the Initial Purchase 
Price, the “Purchase Price”). The Private Units will be identical to the
 units to be sold in the IPO except as to be described in the Company’s 
registration statement filed in connection with the IPO (“Registration 
Statement”). At least 24 hours prior to the effective date (“Effective 
Date”) of the Registration Statement, the undersigned will cause the 
Purchase Price to be delivered to Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP, counsel for the
 Company (“Counsel”), by wire transfer as set forth in the instructions 
attached as Exhibit A hereto to hold in a non-interest bearing account 
until the Company consummates the IPO. The undersigned agrees that if 
the size of the IPO is increased or decreased for any reason, the amount
 of the undersigned’s investment will be either increased or decreased, 
as applicable, so that the undersigned’s percentage of the aggregate 
investment in Private Units (collectively, the “Private Securities”) 
made by the undersigned and other investors of the Company remains the 
same. If the size of the offering is increased, the undersigned agrees 
that it will deliver the purchase price for such additional Private 
Securities to Counsel as set forth above or as promptly as is reasonably
 practicable following the increase if it is on the Effective Date. If 
the size of the offering is decreased, the unused portion of the 
Purchase Price shall be returned to the undersigned.</p>
