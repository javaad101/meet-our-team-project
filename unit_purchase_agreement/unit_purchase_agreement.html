<p align="CENTER">UNIT PURCHASE AGREEMENT</p>
<p align="CENTER">BETWEEN</p>
<p align="CENTER">THE REGISTRANT AND FORTUNE JOY CAPITAL CORP</p>

<p>_______________, 2022</p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>Fortune Joy International Acquisition Corp (“Company”), a blank check
 company formed for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses or 
entities (a “Business Combination”), intends to register its securities 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”), in 
connection with its initial public offering (“IPO”). The Company 
currently anticipates selling units in the IPO, each comprised of one 
Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company 
(“Ordinary Shares”) and one warrant to purchase one Ordinary Share 
(“Warrant”).</p>

<p>The undersigned hereby commits to purchase an aggregate of 465,000 
units of the Company (“Initial Units”) at $10.00 per Initial Unit for an
 aggregate purchase price of $4,650,000 (the “Initial Purchase Price”). 
Additionally, if the underwriters in the IPO exercise their 
over-allotment option in full or part, the undersigned further commits 
to purchase up to an additional 45,000 Units (“Additional Units” and 
together with the Initial Units, the “Private Units”) at $10.00 per 
Additional Unit for an aggregate purchase price of up to $450,000 (the 
“Over-Allotment Purchase Price” and together with the Initial Purchase 
Price, the “Purchase Price”). The Private Units will be identical to the
 units to be sold in the IPO except as to be described in the Company’s 
registration statement filed in connection with the IPO (“Registration 
Statement”). At least 24 hours prior to the effective date (“Effective 
Date”) of the Registration Statement, the undersigned will cause the 
Purchase Price to be delivered to Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP, counsel for the
 Company (“Counsel”), by wire transfer as set forth in the instructions 
attached as Exhibit A hereto to hold in a non-interest bearing account 
until the Company consummates the IPO. The undersigned agrees that if 
the size of the IPO is increased or decreased for any reason, the amount
 of the undersigned’s investment will be either increased or decreased, 
as applicable, so that the undersigned’s percentage of the aggregate 
investment in Private Units (collectively, the “Private Securities”) 
made by the undersigned and other investors of the Company remains the 
same. If the size of the offering is increased, the undersigned agrees 
that it will deliver the purchase price for such additional Private 
Securities to Counsel as set forth above or as promptly as is reasonably
 practicable following the increase if it is on the Effective Date. If 
the size of the offering is decreased, the unused portion of the 
Purchase Price shall be returned to the undersigned.</p>

<p>The consummation of the purchase and issuance of the Initial Units 
and Additional Units (if any) shall occur simultaneously with the 
consummation of the IPO and over-allotment option, respectively. 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, Counsel shall deposit 
the Initial Purchase Price, without interest or deduction, into the 
trust fund (“Trust Fund”) established by the Company for the benefit of 
the Company’s public shareholders as described in the Registration 
Statement. Simultaneously with the consummation of all or any part of 
the over-allotment option, Counsel shall deposit the pro-rata portion of
 the Over-Allotment Purchase Price, based upon the amount of the 
over-allotment option that has been exercised, without interest or 
deduction, into the Trust Fund. Upon expiration of the over-allotment 
option, Counsel shall return any unused portion of the Over-Allotment 
Purchase Price to the undersigned. If the Company does not complete the 
IPO within thirty (30) days from the Effective Date, the Purchase Price 
(without interest or deduction) will be returned to the undersigned.</p>

<p>Each of the Company and the undersigned acknowledges and agrees that 
Counsel is serving hereunder solely as a convenience to the parties to 
facilitate the purchase of the Private Securities and Counsel’s sole 
obligation under this letter agreement is to act with respect to holding
 and disbursing the Purchase Price for the Private Securities as 
described above. Counsel shall not be liable to the Company or the 
undersigned or any other person or entity in respect of any act or 
failure to act hereunder or otherwise in connection with performing its 
services hereunder unless Counsel has acted in a manner constituting 
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company shall indemnify 
Counsel against any claim made against it (including reasonable 
attorney’s fees) by reason of it acting or failing to act in connection 
with this letter agreement except as a result of its gross negligence or
 willful misconduct. Counsel may rely and shall be protected in acting 
or refraining from acting upon any written notice, instruction or 
request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and 
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.</p>

<p>The Private Units will be identical to the units to be sold by the Company in the IPO, except that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the undersigned agrees to vote the Ordinary Shares included in 
the Private Units (“Private Shares”) in favor of any proposed Business 
Combination;</li>
    <li>the warrants included in the Private Units (i) will not be 
redeemable by the Company and (ii) may be exchanged or exercised for 
cash or on a cashless basis, as described in the Registration Statement,
 in each case so long as they are held by the undersigned or any of its 
permitted transferees;</li>
    <li>the undersigned agrees not to seek conversion, or seek to sell 
such shares in any tender offer, in connection with any proposed 
Business Combination with respect to the Private Shares;</li>
    <li>the Private Securities and underlying securities will not be 
transferable by the undersigned until the consummation of a Business 
Combination (subject to certain exceptions as described in the 
Registration Statement);</li>
    <li>the Private Securities will be subject to customary registration
 rights, pursuant to a registration rights agreement on terms agreed 
upon by the Company and the Underwriters to be filed as an exhibit to 
the Registration Statement;</li>
    <li>the undersigned will not participate in any liquidation 
distribution with respect to the Private Securities or the underlying 
securities (but will participate in liquidation distributions with 
respect to any units or Ordinary Shares purchased by the undersigned in 
the IPO or in the open market after the IPO) if the Company fails to 
consummate a Business Combination; and</li>
    <li>the Private Securities and the underlying securities will 
include any additional terms or restrictions as is customary in other 
similarly structured blank check company offerings or as may be 
reasonably required by the underwriters in the IPO in order to 
consummate the IPO, each of which will be set forth in the Registration 
Statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that it will execute 
agreements in form and substance typical for transactions of this nature
 necessary to effectuate the foregoing agreements and obligations prior 
to the consummation of the IPO as are reasonably acceptable to the 
undersigned, including but not limited to (i) an insider letter, (ii) an
 escrow agreement and (iii) a registration rights agreement.</p>

<p>The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that, as applicable:</p>

    <li>it has been advised that the Private Securities and the underlying securities have not been registered under the Securities Act;</li>
    <li>it is acquiring the Private Securities and the underlying securities for its account for investment purposes only;</li>
