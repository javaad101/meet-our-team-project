<p>The terms on which the Company is willing to sell the Shares to the 
Subscriber pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
 amended (the <b>“Securities Act”</b>), and the Company and the Subscriber’s agreements regarding the Shares, are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <u>Purchase of Shares</u>. The Company hereby sells and issues to 
the Subscriber, and the Subscriber hereby purchases from the Company the
 Shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, on the terms and 
subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement (this <b>“Agreement”</b>).
 Concurrently with the Subscriber’s execution of this Agreement, the 
Company is delivering to the Subscriber certificate(s) registered in the
 Subscriber’s name representing the Shares, receipt of which the 
Subscriber hereby acknowledges.</p>

<p>2. <u>Representations, Warranties and Agreements.</u></p>
    <p>2.1. <u>Subscriber’s Representations, Warranties and Agreements.</u>
 To induce the Company to issue the Shares to the Subscriber, the 
Subscriber hereby represents and warrants to the Company and agrees with
 the Company as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><u>No Government Recommendation or Approval.</u> The 
Subscriber understands that no United States federal or state agency or 
similar agency of any other country has passed upon or made any 
recommendation or endorsement of the offering of the Shares.</li>
        <li><u>No Conflicts</u>. The execution, delivery and performance
 of this Agreement and the consummation by the Subscriber of the 
transactions contemplated hereby do not violate, conflict with or 
constitute a default under (i) the provisions of the organizational 
documents of the Subscriber, if any, (ii) any agreement, indenture or 
instrument to which the Subscriber is a party, or (iii) any law, 
statute, rule or regulation to which the Subscriber is subject, or any 
agreement, order, judgment or decree to which the Subscriber is subject.</li>
        <li><u>Organization and Authority.</u> Upon execution and 
delivery by the Subscriber, this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding
 agreement of the Subscriber, enforceable against the Subscriber in 
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited 
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar 
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and 
subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether 
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).</li>
        <li><u>Experience, Financial Capability and Suitability</u>. the
 Subscriber is: (i) sophisticated in financial matters and is able to 
evaluate the risks and benefits of the investment in the Shares and (ii)
 able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Shares for an 
indefinite period of time because the Shares have not been registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933 and therefore cannot be sold unless 
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from 
such registration is available. The Subscriber has substantial 
experience in evaluating and investing in transactions of securities in 
companies similar to the Company so that he or she is capable of 
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Company and has
 the capacity to protect its own interests. The Subscriber must bear the
 economic risk of this investment until the Shares are sold pursuant to:
 (i) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or 
(ii) an exemption from registration available with respect to such sale.
 The Subscriber is able to bear the economic risks of an investment in 
the Shares and to afford a complete loss of Subscriber’s investment in 
the Shares.</li>
        <li><u>Access to Information; Independent Investigation</u>. 
Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Subscriber has had the 
opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from representatives
 of the Company concerning an investment in the Company, as well as the 
finances, operations, business and prospects of the Company, and the 
opportunity to obtain additional information to verify the accuracy of 
all information so obtained. In determining whether to make this 
investment, Subscriber has relied solely on Subscriber’s own knowledge 
and understanding of the Company and its business based upon 
Subscriber’s own due diligence investigation and the information 
furnished pursuant to this paragraph. Subscriber understands that no 
person has been authorized to give any information or to make any 
representations which were not furnished pursuant to this Section 2 and 
Subscriber has not relied on any other representations or information in
 making its investment decision, whether written or oral, relating to 
the Company, its operations and/or its prospects.</li>
        <li><u>Private Offering</u>. The Subscriber acknowledges the 
sale contemplated hereby is being made in reliance on a private 
placement exemption pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.</li>
        <li><u>Investment Purposes.</u> The Subscriber is purchasing the
 Shares solely for investment purposes, for the Subscriber’s own account
 and not for the account or benefit of any other person, and not with a 
view towards the distribution or dissemination thereof and the 
Subscriber has no present arrangement to sell the interest in the Shares
 to or through any person or entity. The Subscriber did not decide to 
enter into this Agreement as a result of any general solicitation or 
general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502 under the Securities 
Act.</li>
        <li><u>Restrictions on Transfer; Shell Company; Affiliate Status</u>.
 The Subscriber understands the Shares are being offered in a 
transaction not involving a public offering within the meaning of the 
Securities Act. Subscriber understands the Shares will be “restricted 
securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities 
Act and Subscriber understands that the certificates representing the 
Shares will contain a legend in respect of such restrictions. If in the 
future the Subscriber decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise 
transfer the Shares, the Shares may be offered, resold, pledged or 
otherwise transferred only pursuant to: (i) registration under the 
Securities Act, or (ii) an available exemption from registration. 
Subscriber agrees that if any transfer of its Shares or any interest 
therein is proposed to be made, as a condition precedent to any such 
transfer, Subscriber may be required to deliver to the Company an 
opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company. Absent registration or 
an exemption, the Subscriber agrees not to resell the Shares. The 
Subscriber further acknowledges that because the Company is a shell 
company, Rule 144 may not be available to the Subscriber for the resale 
of the Shares until one year following consummation of the initial 
business combination of the Company, despite technical compliance with 
the requirements of Rule 144 and the release or waiver of any 
contractual transfer restrictions. The Subscriber (a) acknowledges that 
after the issuance of the Shares, the Subscriber may be deemed an 
“affiliate” of the Company under the Securities Act, (b) acknowledges 
understanding the additional restrictions under the Securities Act 
applicable to affiliate of the Company, and (c) acknowledges that it had
 a full and fair opportunity and the means to obtain United States 
securities counsel and discuss such restrictions prior to entering into 
this Agreement.</li>
        <li><u>No Governmental Consents</u>. No governmental, 
administrative or other third party consents or approvals are required, 
necessary or appropriate on the part of Subscriber in connection with 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</li>
        <li><u>Bad Actor</u>. The Subscriber is not subject to any of 
the “Bad Actor” disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(l)(i) to 
(viii) under the Securities Act (a <b>“Disqualification Event”</b>), 
except for a Disqualification Event covered by Rule 506(d)(2) or (d)(3) 
under the Securities Act, The Subscriber has exercised reasonable care 
to determine whether he, she or it is subject to a Disqualification 
Event. The purchase of the Shares will not subject the Company to any 
Disqualification Event. There are no matters that would have triggered 
disqualification under Rule 506(d)(l) under the Securities Act but 
occurred before September 23, 2013.</li>
        <li><u>No Legal Advice from Company.</u> The Subscriber 
acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to review this Agreement 
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other 
agreements entered into between the parties hereto with its own legal 
counsel and investment and tax advisors. Except for any statements or 
representations of the Company made in this Agreement and the other 
agreements entered into between the parties hereto, the Subscriber is 
relying solely on such counsel and advisors and not on any statements or
 representations of the Company or any of its representatives or agents 
for legal, tax or investment advice with respect to this investment, the
 transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the securities laws of 
any jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><u>Reliance on Representations and Warranties.</u> The 
Subscriber understands the Shares are being offered and sold to it in 
reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements under the 
Securities Act, and analogous provisions in the laws and regulations of 
various states, and that the Company is relying upon the truth and 
accuracy of the representations, warranties, agreements, acknowledgments
 and understandings of the Subscriber set forth in this Agreement in 
order to determine the applicability of such provisions.</li>
        <li>No General Solicitation or General Advertising; No Directed 
Selling Efforts. The Subscriber is not aware of any form of general 
solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Regulation S)
 in respect of the Shares, including (I) any advertisement, article, 
notice or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or 
similar media or broadcast over television, radio, or the internet; and

general solicitation or general advertising.</li>
