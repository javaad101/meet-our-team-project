                                            The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the
                                            prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us

                                            particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine

                                        combination within the completion window. Consequently, such target business may
                                        obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if
