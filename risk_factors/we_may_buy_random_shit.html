                                            are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into
                                            our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such
                                            criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we
                                            enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely
                                            consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.

                                        Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating
                                        prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which
                                        we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these
                                        positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a
                                        target that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines, such
                                        combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does
                                        meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a
                                        prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general
                                        criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their
                                        redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing
                                        condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or
                                        a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the
                                        transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement,
                                        or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it
                                        may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial
                                        business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria
                                        and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination,
                                        our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per share, or less
                                        in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our
                                        warrants will expire worthless.
