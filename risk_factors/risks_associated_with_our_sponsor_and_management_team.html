    Risks Associated with Our Sponsor and Management Team

</p>
<p class="H3">

    Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to
    be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our key
    personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business
    combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the
    operations and profitability of our


    post-combination


    business.

</p>
<p>
    Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent
    upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the
    target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our
    key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or
    advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that
    some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While
</p>


<p>
    we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial
    business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these
    individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with
    the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause
    us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign
    upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business
    combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and
    profitability of our post

    -combination

    business. The role of an acquisition candidate’s key personnel upon the
    completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this
    time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s
    management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following
    our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management
    of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key
    personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post

    -combination

    business.
</p>
<p class="H3">

    We are dependent upon our officers and directors and their departure could
    adversely affect our ability to operate.

</p>
<p>
    Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals. We
    believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and
    directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In
    addition, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified
    amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest
    in allocating their time among various business activities, including
    identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due
    diligence. Moreover, certain of our officers and directors have time and
    attention requirements for investment funds of which affiliates of our sponsor
    are the investment managers. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key

    -man

    insurance on the life of, any of our directors or officers. The unexpected loss
    of the services of one or more of our directors or officers could have a
    detrimental effect on us.
</p>
<p class="H3">

    Since our initial shareholders will lose their entire investment in us if
    our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect
    to any public shares they may acquire), a conflict of interest may arise in
    determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate
    for our initial business combination.

</p>
<p>
    On August 30, 2021, our initial shareholders paid $25,000 to cover certain of
    our offering costs in consideration for 1,150,000 founder shares. On November


    15, 2021, we issued additional 1,006,250 Class B ordinary shares to the initial
    shareholders as founder shares for no consideration. Taking into the additional
    share issuance, the founder shares were sold at $0.012 per share. As such, our
    initial shareholders will collectively own 20% of our issued and outstanding
    shares after this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying
    the private placement units and any units they may purchase in this offering).
    If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a
    capitalization or share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism,
    as applicable, with respect to our founder shares immediately prior to the
    consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of
    founder shares at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the
    consummation of this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying
    the private placement units and any units they may purchase in this offering).
    The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business
    combination. In addition, our sponsor has committed to purchase an aggregate of
    465,000 private placement units at $10.00 per unit (or 510,000 if the
    underwriters’ over

    -allotment

    option is exercised in full), for a purchase price of $4,650,000 in the
    aggregate (or $5,100,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over

    -allotment

    option is exercised in full), that will also be worthless if we do not complete
    a business combination.
</p>
<p>
    The founder shares are identical to the ordinary shares included in the units
    being sold in this offering except that: (1) prior to our initial business
    combination, only holders of the founder shares have the right to vote on the
    appointment of directors and holders of a majority of our founder shares may
    remove a member of the board of directors for any reason; (2) the founder shares
    are subject to certain transfer restrictions; (3) our initial shareholders have
    entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to
    waive: (x) their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any
    public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial
    business combination (and not seek to sell its shares to us in any tender offer
    we undertake in connection with our initial business combination); (y) their
    redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares
    held by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to
    our memorandum and articles of association (A) that would affect our public
    shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a
    business combination as described herein or to modify the substance or timing of
    our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
    initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to
    any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre

    -initial

    business combination activity; and (z) their rights to liquidating distributions
    from the
</p>


<p>
    trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to
    complete our initial business combination within the completion window (although
    they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
    respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial
    business combination within the prescribed time frame); (4) the founder shares
    will automatically convert into our Class A ordinary shares on the first
    business day following the completion of our initial business combination on a
    one

    -for


    -one

    basis subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti

    -dilution

    rights and (5) the founder shares are entitled to registration rights. Our
    directors and officers have also entered into the letter agreement with respect
    to public shares acquired by them, if any.
</p>
<p>
    The personal and financial interests of our sponsor, officers and directors may
    influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business
    combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the
    operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk
    may become more acute as the 12

    -month

    (or up to 18

    -month

    as may be extended) deadline following the closing of this offering nears, which
    is the deadline for the completion of our initial business combination.
</p>
<p class="H3">

    Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the
    future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities
    similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have
    conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business
    opportunity should be presented.

</p>
<p>
    Following the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial
    business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and
    combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and officers and directors
    are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a
    similar business, and they are not prohibited from sponsoring, or otherwise
    becoming involved with, other blank check companies prior to us completing our
    initial business combination. Moreover, certain of our officers and directors
    have time and attention requirements for investment funds of which affiliates of
    our sponsor are the investment managers.
</p>
<p>
    Our officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which
    may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they
    owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have
    conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business
    opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our
    favor and a potential target business may be presented to other entities prior
    to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman
    Islands law. Our memorandum and articles of association will provide that, to
    the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a
    director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly
    assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same
    or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce
    any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate
    in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for
    any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
</p>
<p>
    For a complete discussion of our officers’ and directors’ business affiliations
    and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, please see
    “

    Management — Directors, Director Nominees and Executive Officers

    ,” “

    Management — Conflicts of Interest” and “Certain Relationships and Related
    Party Transactions

    .”
</p>
<p class="H3">

    Our officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates
    may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.

</p>
<p>
    We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers,
    security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or
    financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in
    any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may
    enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with
    our sponsor, directors or officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do
    we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for
    their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us.
    Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their
    interests and ours.
</p>
<p>
    In particular, affiliates of our sponsor have invested in industries as diverse
    as wireless communication, e

    -commerce

    , block

    -chain

    technology and social media. As a result, there may be substantial overlap
    between companies that would be a suitable business combination for us and
    companies that would make an attractive target for such other affiliates.
</p>


<p class="H3">

    We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses
    that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our
    sponsor, officers or directors which may raise potential conflicts of
    interest.

</p>
<p>
    In light of the involvement of our sponsor, officers and directors with other
    entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our
    sponsor, officers and directors. Our officers and directors also serve as
    officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation,
    those described under “

    Management — Conflicts of Interest

    .” Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our
    sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific
    opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any
    entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary
    discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities.
    Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction
    with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we
    determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business
    combination as set forth in “

    Proposed Business — Effecting Our Initial Business Combination — Selection
    of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination

    ” and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and
    disinterested directors.
</p>
<p class="H3">

    Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business
    after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that,
    upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the
    skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such
    business.

</p>
<p>
    We may structure our initial business combination so that the post

    -transaction

    company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of
    the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will complete such
    business combination only if the post

    -transaction

    company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting
    securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the
    target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an
    investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any
    transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post

    -transaction

    company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our
    shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a
    minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on
    valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination
    transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a
    substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the
    issued and outstanding share capital, shares or other equity interests of a
    target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However,
    as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary
    shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less
    than a majority of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent
    to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently
    combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger
    portion of the company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this
    may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our
    control of the target business.
</p>
<p class="H3">
    Our shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interest against
    members of our management team who are located outside of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    Two members of our management team are located outside of the United States.
    Long Chen, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and Xingyun
    (Tracy) Xu, our Chief Financial Officer and Director, reside in China, are
    citizens of China and their assets are located outside of the United States. As
    a result, it may be difficult or impossible for a shareholder to bring an action
    against our officers and directors outside the United States in the event that a
    shareholder believes that his rights have been infringed under the securities
    laws or otherwise. Even if a shareholder is successful in bringing an action of
    this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render the
    shareholder unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of
    officers and directors located outside of the United States. There is no
    statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United
    States, although the courts of the Cayman Islands will generally recognize and
    enforce a non

    -penal

    judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the
    merits.
</p>
<p>
    Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of
    association, as amended and restated from time to time, and by the Companies Law
    (Revised) and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to
    take legal action against our officers and directors located outside of the
    United States, and the fiduciary responsibilities of our officers and directors
    located outside of the United States are to a large extent governed by the
    common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is
    derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman
    Islands as well as from English common law, which provides persuasive, but not
    binding, authority on a court in the Cayman
</p>


<p>
    Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of
    our officers and directors located outside of the United States under Cayman
    Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or
    judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has
    a less developed body of securities laws than the United States and provides
    significantly less protection to investors. In addition, Cayman Islands
    companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in
    U.S. federal courts.
</p>
<p>
    Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under China’s
    Civil Procedure Law. China’s courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments
    in accordance with the requirements of the Civil Procedure Law based either on
    treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on
    reciprocity between jurisdictions. There are no treaties between China and the
    United States for the mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments,
    thus making the recognition and enforcement of a U.S. court judgment in China
    difficult.
</p>
<p>
    As a result, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their
    interests through actions against our officers, and directors located outside of
    the United States than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a
    jurisdiction in the United States.
</p>
