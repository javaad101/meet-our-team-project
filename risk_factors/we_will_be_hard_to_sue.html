                                            After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of
                                            our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all or
                                            substantially all of our assets will be located outside the United States;
                                            therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or
                                            their other legal rights.

                                        the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process
                                        upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States
                                        courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors
                                        and officers under United States laws.
