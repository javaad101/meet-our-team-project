                                            We may face additional and distinctive risks if we acquire a technology
                                            business.

                                        Business combinations with technology businesses may involve special
                                        considerations and risks. If we complete our initial business combination with a
                                        technology business, we will be subject to the following risks, any of which
                                        could be detrimental to us and the business we acquire:
                                    </li><li>If we are unable to keep pace with evolving technology and changes in the
                                        technology services industry, our revenues and future prospects may decline;
                                    </li><li>Any business or company we acquire could be vulnerable to cyberattack or theft
                                        of individual identities or personal data;
                                    </li><li>Difficulties with any products or services we provide could damage our
                                        reputation and business;
                                    </li><li>A failure to comply with privacy regulations could adversely affect relations
                                        with customers and have a negative impact on business;
                                    </li><li>We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and we may be subject to
                                        infringement claims; and
                                    </li><li>We and any business or company we acquire may not be able to adapt to the
                                        complex and evolving regulatory environment for financial technology services
                                        locally.

                                        Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our operations following a
                                        business combination. However, our efforts in identifying prospective target
                                        businesses will not be limited to technology businesses. Accordingly, if we
                                        acquire a target business in another industry, these risks will likely not
                                        affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific
                                        industry in which we operate or target business which we acquire, none of which
                                        can be presently ascertained.
