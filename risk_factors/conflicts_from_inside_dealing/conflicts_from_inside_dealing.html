                                            Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a
                                            target business in connection with a particular business combination. These
                                            agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our
                                            initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have
                                            conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business
                                            combination is the most advantageous.

                                        Our key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of
                                        our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment
                                        or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such
                                        negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the
                                        business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive
                                        compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services
                                        they would render to us after the completion of our initial business
                                        combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may
                                        influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business,
                                        subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. However, we believe
                                        the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our
                                        initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision
                                        as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination.
                                        There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with
                                        us after the completion of our initial business combination. We cannot assure
                                        you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory
                                        positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will
                                        remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination. Our
                                        memorandum and articles of association will provide that, to the fullest extent
                                        permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an
                                        officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by
                                        contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar
                                        business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any
                                        interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in,
                                        any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any
                                        director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.
