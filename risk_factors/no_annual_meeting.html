                                            Combination.

                                        In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required
                                        to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end
                                        following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act
                                        for us to hold annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings to
                                        appoint directors. Until we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders
                                        may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management.
                                        As holders of our ClassÂ A ordinary shares, our public shareholders also will not
                                        have the right to vote on the appointment of directors prior to completion of
                                        our initial business combination. In addition, holders of a majority of our
                                        founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason.
