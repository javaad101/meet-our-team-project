                                            If any dividend is declared in the future and paid in a foreign currency,
                                            you may be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. dollars than the U.S. dollar
                                            amount that you will actually ultimately receive.

                                        If you are a U.S. holder of our ordinary shares, you will be taxed on the
                                        U.S. dollar value of your dividends, if any, at the time you receive them, even
                                        if you actually receive a smaller amount of U.S. dollars when the payment is in
                                        fact converted into U.S. dollars. Specifically, if a dividend is declared and
                                        paid in a foreign currency, the amount of the dividend distribution that you
                                        must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of
                                        the
                                    </p>

                                        payments made in the foreign currency, determined at the spot rate of the
                                        foreign currency to the U.S. dollar on the date the dividend distribution is
                                        includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact
                                        converted into U.S. dollars. Thus, if the value of the foreign currency
                                        decreases before you actually convert the currency into U.S. dollars, you will
                                        be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. dollars than the U.S. dollar amount that you
                                        will actually ultimately receive.
