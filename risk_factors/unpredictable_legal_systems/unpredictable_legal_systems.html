                                            Many countries have difficult and unpredictable legal systems and
                                            underdeveloped laws and regulations that are unclear and subject to
                                            corruption and inexperience, which may adversely impact our results of
                                            operations and financial condition.

                                        regard to legal actions taken against us in a given country, may be difficult or

                                        Rules and regulations in many countries are often ambiguous or open to differing
                                        interpretation by responsible individuals and agencies at the municipal, state,
                                        regional and federal levels. The attitudes and actions of such individuals and
                                        agencies are often difficult to predict and inconsistent.
