                                            Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for
                                            business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to
                                            complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our
                                            initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only
                                            approximately $10.20 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our
                                            redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless.

                                        We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business
                                        objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals
                                        or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities,
                                        domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to
                                        acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have
                                        extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly,
                                        acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various
                                        industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other
                                        resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial
                                        resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these
                                        competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could
                                        potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the
                                        private placement units, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition
                                        of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available
                                        financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an
                                        advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore,
                                        in the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination
                                        and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will
                                        potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
                                        combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage
                                        in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete
