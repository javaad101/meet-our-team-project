                                            with U.S. securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources

                                        Following our initial business combination, any or all of our management could
                                        resign from their positions as officers of the Company, and the management of
                                        the target business at the time of the business combination could remain in
                                        place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with
                                        U.S. securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with U.S. securities laws,
                                        they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws.
                                        This could be expensive and time
