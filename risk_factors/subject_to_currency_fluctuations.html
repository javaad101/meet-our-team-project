                                            Currency policies may cause a target business’ ability to succeed in the

                                        could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency.
                                        The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by,
                                        among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in

                                        consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business
                                        as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are
                                        able to consummate such transaction.
