                                            financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of
                                            revenue or earnings, which could subject us to volatile revenues or earnings
                                            or difficulty in retaining key personnel.

                                        entity with a limited operating history, a financially unstable business, or an
                                        entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings, we may be affected
                                        by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we
                                        combine. These risks include investing in a business without a proven business
                                        model and with limited historical financial data, a lack of revenues or earnings
                                        and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers
                                        and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular
                                        target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all the
                                        significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due
                                        diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and
                                        leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will
                                        adversely impact a target business.
