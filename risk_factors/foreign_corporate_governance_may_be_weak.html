                                            Corporate governance standards in foreign countries may not be as strict or
                                            developed as in the United States and such weakness may hide issues and
                                            operational practices that are detrimental to a target business.

                                        General corporate governance standards in some countries are weak in that they
                                        do not prevent business practices that cause unfavorable related party
                                        transactions, over-leveraging, improper accounting, family company interconnectivity and poor management.
                                        Local laws often do not go far enough to prevent improper business practices.
                                        Therefore, shareholders may not be treated impartially and equally as a result
                                        of poor management practices, asset shifting, conglomerate structures that
                                        result in preferential treatment to some parts of the overall company, and
                                        cronyism. The lack of transparency and ambiguity in the regulatory process also
                                        may result in inadequate credit evaluation and weakness that may precipitate or
                                        encourage financial crisis. In our evaluation of a business combination we will

                                        to evaluate the corporate governance of a target and the business environment,
                                        and in accordance with United States laws for reporting companies take steps to
                                        implement practices that will cause compliance with all applicable rules and
                                        accounting practices. Notwithstanding these intended efforts, there may be
                                        endemic practices and local laws that could add risk to an investment we
                                        ultimately make and that result in an adverse effect on our operations and

                                        Companies in foreign countries may be subject to accounting, auditing,
                                        regulatory and financial standards and requirements that differ, in some cases
                                        significantly, from those applicable to public companies in the United States,
                                        which may make it more difficult or complex to consummate a business
                                        combination. In particular, the assets and profits appearing on the financial
                                        statements of a foreign company may not reflect its financial position or
                                        results of operations in the way they would be reflected had such financial
                                        statements been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and there may be
                                        substantially less publicly available information about companies in certain
                                        jurisdictions than there is about comparable United States companies. Moreover,
                                        foreign companies may not be subject to the same degree of regulation as are
                                        United States companies with respect to such matters as insider trading rules,
                                        tender offer regulation, shareholder proxy requirements and the timely
                                        disclosure of information.
