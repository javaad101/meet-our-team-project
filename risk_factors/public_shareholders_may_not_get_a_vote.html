                                            Our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our
                                            proposed business combination, and even if we hold a vote, holders of our
                                            founder shares will participate in such vote and vote in favor of the
                                            business combination, which means we may complete our initial business
                                            combination even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support
                                            such a combination.

                                        We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination
                                        at a general meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may
                                        elect to redeem their public shares without voting, and if they do vote,
                                        irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed business
                                        combination, or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to
                                        redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
                                        initial business combination by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the
                                        need for a shareholder vote), in each in cash, for an amount payable in cash
                                        equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of
                                        two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination,
                                        including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by
                                        the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the
                                        limitations described herein. Accordingly, it is possible that we will
                                        consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our
                                        public shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. The
                                        decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business
                                        combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender
                                        offer will be made by us, solely at our discretion, and will be based on a
                                        variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms
                                        of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. For
                                        instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of
                                        a general meeting but would still require us to obtain shareholder approval if
                                        we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding shares to a
                                        target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we
                                        were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20%
                                        of our issued and outstanding shares, we would seek shareholder approval of such
                                        business combination instead of conducting a tender offer. Even if we seek
                                        shareholder approval, the holders of our founder shares will participate in the
                                        vote on such approval and vote in favor of the business combination.
                                        Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if a majority
                                        of our public shareholders do not approve of the business combination we
                                        complete.
