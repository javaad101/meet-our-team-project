                                        We will consider a business combination outside of our management’s area of
                                        expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we
                                        determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for
                                        our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
                                        inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you
                                        that we will adequately ascertain or assess all the significant risk factors. We
                                        also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove
                                        to be less favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment, if
                                        an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event
                                        we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management’s
                                        expertise, our management’s expertise may not be directly applicable to its
                                        evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus
                                        regarding the areas of our management’s expertise would not be relevant to an
                                        understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our
                                        management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all the significant
                                        risk factors. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders
                                        following our business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of
                                        their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction
                                        in value.

                                        Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our

                                        holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder
                                        approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result,

                                        prices of our securities may be more volatile.

                                        public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the

                                        Our corporate affairs will be governed by our memorandum and articles of
                                        association, the Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The
                                        rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority
                                        shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under Cayman
                                        Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman
                                        Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from
                                        comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from
                                        English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority,
                                        but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our
                                        shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under Cayman Islands law
                                        are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in
                                        some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a
                                        different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain
                                        states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially
                                        interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may
                                        not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal
                                        court of the United States.

                                        We have been advised by Maples and Calder (Hong Kong) LLP, our Cayman Islands
                                        legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (1) to
                                        recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States
                                        predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of
                                        the United States or any state; and (2) in original actions brought in the
                                        Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil
                                        liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any
                                        state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in
                                        nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in
                                        the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the
                                        Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign
                                        court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the
                                        principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment
                                        debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided
                                        certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman
                                        Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum,
                                        and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a
                                        Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the
                                        grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of
                                        which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands
                                        (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to
                                        public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if
                                        concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.
                                    </p>

                                        As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in
                                        protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members
                                        of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public

                                        This choice of forum provision may increase a shareholder’s cost and limit the
