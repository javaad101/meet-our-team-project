                                        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
                                        not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
                                        pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors,
                                        officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may purchase public shares or
                                        public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or
                                        in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial
                                        business combination, although they are under no obligation or duty to do so.
                                        Please see “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases of our securities” for a
                                        description of how such persons will determine from which shareholders to seek
                                        to acquire securities. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement
                                        that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no
                                        longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its
                                        redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
                                        or any of their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions
                                        from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption
                                        rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination,
                                        such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to
                                        redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business
                                        combination. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different
                                        than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to
                                        redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. The
                                        purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of our initial
                                        business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining
                                        shareholder approval of our initial business combination or to satisfy a closing
                                        condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net
                                        worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business
                                        combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met.
                                        This may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may
                                        not otherwise have been possible.

                                        In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A
                                        ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our
                                        securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain
                                        the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities
                                        exchange.
