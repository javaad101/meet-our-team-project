                                            Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not
                                            completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to
                                            locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to
                                            complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may
                                            receive only approximately $10.20 per share, or less than such amount in
                                            certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our
                                            warrants will expire worthless.

                                        We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the
                                        negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents
                                        and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and
                                        substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to
                                        complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that
                                        point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore,
                                        if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to
                                        complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including
                                        those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the
                                        related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent
                                        attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable
                                        to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may
                                        receive only approximately $10.20 per share, or less in certain circumstances,
                                        on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
