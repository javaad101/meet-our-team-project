                                        for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, as further described herein. Any
                                        redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected

                                        (or up to 18 months as may be extended) before the redemption proceeds of our

                                        rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to
                                        return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation
                                        unless, prior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend
                                        certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association and then only
                                        in cases where investors have properly sought to redeem their Class A ordinary
                                        shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be
                                        entitled to distributions if we are unable to complete our initial business
                                        combination and do not amend certain provisions of our memorandum and articles
