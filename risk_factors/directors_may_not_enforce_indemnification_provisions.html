                                            Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of
                                            our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust
                                            account available for distribution to our public shareholders.

                                        In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser
                                        of (1) $10.20 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per share held in the
                                        trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to
                                        reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest
                                        which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable
                                        to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related
                                        to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take
                                        legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations.
                                        While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action
                                        on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to
                                        us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business
                                        judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent
                                        directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of
                                        funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders
                                        may be reduced below $10.20 per share.
