                                            We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with
                                            multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our
                                            initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that
                                            could negatively impact our operations and profitability.

                                        If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by
                                        different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our
                                        purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other
                                        business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our
                                        ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business
                                        combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens
                                        and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence
                                        investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks
                                        associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or
                                        products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are
                                        unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our
                                        profitability and results of operations.
