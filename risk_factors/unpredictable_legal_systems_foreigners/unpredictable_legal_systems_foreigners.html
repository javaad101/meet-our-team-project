                                            Many countries have difficult and unpredictable legal systems and
                                            underdeveloped laws and regulations that are unclear and subject to
                                            corruption and inexperience, which may adversely impact our results of
                                            operations and financial condition.

                                        Our ability to seek and enforce legal protections, including with respect to
                                        intellectual property and other property rights, or to defend ourselves with
                                        regard to legal actions taken against us in a given country, may be difficult or
                                        impossible, which could adversely impact our operations, assets or financial
                                        condition. Rules and regulations in many countries are often ambiguous or open
                                        to differing interpretation by responsible individuals and agencies at the
                                        municipal, state, regional and federal levels.

                                        The attitudes and actions of such individuals and agencies are often difficult
                                        to predict and inconsistent. Delay with respect to the enforcement of particular
                                        rules and regulations, including those relating to customs, tax, environmental
                                        and labor, could cause serious disruption to operations abroad and negatively
                                        affect our results.
