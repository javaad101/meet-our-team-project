                                        Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we
                                        combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material
                                        issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be
                                        possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due
                                        diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our
                                        control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to
                                        later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur
                                        impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if
                                        our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may
                                        arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with
