                                            In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check
                                            companies have, in the past, amended various provisions of their charters
                                            and modified governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We

                                            of association or governing instruments, in a manner that will make it
                                            easier for us to complete our initial business combination that some of our
                                            shareholders may not support.

                                        In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies
                                        have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and
                                        modified governing instruments. For example, blank check companies have amended
                                        the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and
                                        extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with
                                        respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the
                                        warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our
                                        memorandum and articles of association require at least a special resolution of
                                        our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law. A resolution is deemed to be
                                        a special resolution as a matter of Cayman Islands law where it has been
                                        approved by either (1) at least two

                                        company’s shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the
                                        intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given or
                                        (2) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous
                                        written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders and amending our warrant
                                        agreement will require a vote of holders of at least a majority of the warrants
                                        outstanding (which may include public warrants acquired by our sponsor or its
                                        affiliates in this offering or thereafter in the open market). Our memorandum
                                        and articles of association provide that special resolutions must be approved
                                        either by at least two

                                        amendments relating to the appointment or removal of directors prior to our
                                        initial business combination, which require the approval of at least 90% of our
                                        ordinary shares voting in a general meeting), or by a unanimous written
                                        resolution of all of our shareholders. We cannot assure you that we will not
                                        seek to amend our memorandum and articles of association or governing
                                        instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in
                                        order to effectuate our initial business combination.
