                                            If relations between the United States and foreign governments deteriorate,
                                            it could cause potential target businesses or their goods and services to
                                            become less attractive.

                                        The relationship between the United States and foreign governments could be
                                        subject to sudden fluctuation and periodic tension. For instance, the
                                        United States may announce its intention to impose or increase quotas or tariffs
                                        on certain imports. Such import quotas or tariffs may adversely affect political
                                        relations between the two countries and result in retaliatory countermeasures by
                                        the foreign government in industries that may affect our ultimate target
                                        business. Changes in political conditions in foreign countries and changes in
                                        the state of U.S. relations with such countries are difficult to predict and
                                        could adversely affect our operations or cause potential target businesses or
                                        their goods and services to become less attractive. Because we are not limited
                                        to any specific industry, there is no basis for investors in this offering to
                                        evaluate the possible extent of any impact on our ultimate operations if
                                        relations are strained between the United States and a foreign country in which
                                        we acquire a target business or move our principal manufacturing or service
                                        operations.
