                                            businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will

                                        We may consummate a business combination with a company in any industry we
                                        choose and are not limited to any particular industry or type of business.
                                        Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits
                                        or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate or the
                                        target business which we may ultimately acquire. To the extent we complete a
                                        business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its
                                        early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks
                                        inherent in the business operations of those entities. If we complete a business
                                        combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk,
                                        we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry.
                                        Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a
                                        particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will
                                        properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot
                                        assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less
                                        favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment, if an
                                        opportunity were available, in a target business.
