                                            We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial
                                            business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on
                                            shareholders.

                                        We may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to
                                        requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the
                                        jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another
                                        jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder to recognize taxable
                                        income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder is a tax resident or in
                                        which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not
                                        intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders to pay such taxes.
                                        Shareholders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to
                                        their ownership of us after the reincorporation.
