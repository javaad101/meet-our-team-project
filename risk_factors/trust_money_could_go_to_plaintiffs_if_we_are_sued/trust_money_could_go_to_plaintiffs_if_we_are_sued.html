                                        claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient
                                        funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only
                                        assets are securities of our company. Accordingly, our sponsor may not have
                                        sufficient funds available to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our
                                        sponsor to reserve for such obligations, and therefore, no funds are currently
                                        set aside to cover any such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were
                                        successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial
                                        business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per
                                        public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business
                                        combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection
                                        with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors
                                        will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation,
                                        claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
