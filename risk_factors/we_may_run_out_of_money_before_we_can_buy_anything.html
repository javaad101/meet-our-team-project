                                        sufficient to allow us to operate for at least 12 months (or up to 18 months as

                                        companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with
                                        respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
                                        any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger
                                        agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target
                                        business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a
                                        result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to

                                        business. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of
                                        $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust
