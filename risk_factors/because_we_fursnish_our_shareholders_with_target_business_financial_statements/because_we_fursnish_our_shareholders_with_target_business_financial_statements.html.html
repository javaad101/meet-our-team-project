                                            Because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial
                                            statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous
                                            initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.

                                        The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on
                                        a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include
                                        historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports.
                                        We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our
                                        tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer
                                        rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance
                                        with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the
                                        United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, or international financing reporting
                                        standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS,
                                        depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be
                                        required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
                                        Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement
                                        requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire
                                        because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time
                                        for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy
                                        rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
                                        frame.
