                                        Each of the agreements related to this offering to which we are a party, other
                                        than the investment management trust agreement, may be amended without
                                        shareholder approval. These agreements contain various provisions that our
                                        public shareholders might deem to be material. For example, our letter agreement
                                        and the underwriting agreement contain certain lock
                                        <font class="nobreak">

                                        provisions with respect to the founder shares, private placement units and other
                                        securities held by our initial shareholders, officers and directors.

                                        Amendments to such agreements would require the consent of the applicable
                                        parties thereto and would need to be approved by our board of directors, which
                                        may do so for a variety of reasons, including to facilitate our initial business
                                        combination. While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any
                                        amendment to any of these agreements prior to our initial business combination,
                                        it may be possible that our board of directors, in exercising its business
                                        judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more
                                        amendments to any such agreement. Any material amendment entered into in
                                        connection with the completion of our initial business combination will be
                                        disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable,
                                        related to such initial business combination, and any other material amendment
                                        to any of our material agreements will be disclosed in a filing with the
                                        SEC.Â Any such amendments would not require approval from our shareholders, may
                                        result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not
                                        otherwise have been possible, and may have an adverse effect on the value of an
                                        investment in our securities. For example, amendments to the lock
                                        <font class="nobreak">
                                            -up
                                        </font>
                                        provision discussed above may result in our initial shareholders selling their
                                        securities earlier than they would otherwise be permitted, which may have an
                                        adverse effect on the price of our securities.
