                                        Since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
                                        units are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a
                                        target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a “blank
                                        check” company under the U.S. securities laws. However, because we will have net
                                        tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful completion of this
                                        offering and the sale of the private placement units and will file a Current

                                        , including an audited balance sheet of the Company demonstrating this fact, we
                                        are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check
                                        companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the
                                        benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units
                                        will be immediately tradable and we may have a longer period of time to complete
                                        our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419.
                                        Moreover, if this offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit
                                        the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us
                                        unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in
                                        connection with our completion of an initial business combination. For a more
                                        detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419,
