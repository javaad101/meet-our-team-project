                                            Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us
                                            to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their

                                        If we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions
                                        received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved
                                        that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were
                                        unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As
                                        a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our
                                        shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their
                                        fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and
                                        thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public
                                        shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.
                                        We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these
                                        reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully
                                        authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium
                                        account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary
                                        course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable to a fine of
                                        up to $18,293 and to imprisonment for fiveÂ years in the Cayman Islands.
