                                            We expect to need to comply with the rules of Nasdaq that require our
                                            initial business combination to occur with one or more target businesses
                                            having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets
                                            held in the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the
                                            initial business combination.

                                        The rules of Nasdaq require that our initial business combination occur with one
                                        or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of
                                        at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on
                                        the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter
                                        into the initial business combination. This restriction may limit the type and
                                        number of companies that we may complete a business combination with. If we are
                                        unable to locate a target business or businesses that satisfy this fair market
                                        value test, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per
                                        share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust
                                        account, and our warrants will expire worthless. If we are not then listed on
                                        Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would not be required to satisfy the foregoing
                                        80% fair market value test and could complete a business combination with a
                                        target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the
                                        balance in the trust account. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any
                                        initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent
                                        directors.
