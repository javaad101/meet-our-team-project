                                            As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets
                                            increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more
                                            competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our
                                            initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find
                                            a target or to consummate an initial business combination.

                                        In recentÂ years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have
                                        been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special
                                        purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business
                                        combination, and there are still many companies preparing for an initial public
                                        offering. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available to
                                        consummate an initial business combination.

                                        In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies
                                        seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets,
                                        the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business
                                        models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved
                                        financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons,
                                        such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or
                                        increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business
                                        combinations or operate targets post

                                        combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or
                                        frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination,
                                        and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on
                                        terms favorable to our investors altogether.
