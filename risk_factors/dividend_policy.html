                                        We have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not
                                        intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business
                                        combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon
                                        our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial
                                        condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The
                                        payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination
                                        will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In
                                        addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not
                                        anticipate declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future, except if we
                                        increase the size of this offering, in which case we will effect a
                                        capitalization or other appropriate mechanism immediately prior to the
                                        consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of
                                        founder shares at 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the
                                        consummation of this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying
                                        the private placement units and any units they may purchase in this offering).
                                        Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business
                                        combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive
                                        covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.
                                    </p>
