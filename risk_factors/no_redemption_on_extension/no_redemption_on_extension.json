  "content": [
    "If we are not able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may, by resolution of our board if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination up to six times by an additional one month each time for a total of up to 18 months (the “Paid Extension Period”). In order to avail ourselves of the Paid Extension Period to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposits into the trust account funds equal to thirty-three hundredths of one percent (0.33%) of the gross proceeds of the offering, or $250,000, (or $287,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) for each one-month extension, up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 or $1,725,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full. The amount in the trust account will initially be $10.20 per public share and such amount will be increased by $0.033 per public share for each one-month extension of our time to consummate our initial business combination, as described herein. Our public shareholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. As a result, we may conduct such an extension even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support such an extension and will not be able to redeem their shares in connection therewith. This feature is different than the traditional special purpose acquisition company structure, in which any extension of the company’s period to complete a business combination requires a vote of the company’s shareholders and shareholders have the right to redeem their public shares in connection with such vote."
