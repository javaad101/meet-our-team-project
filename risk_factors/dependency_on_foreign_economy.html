                                            After our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may
                                            be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be
                                            derived from our operations in such country. Accordingly, our results of
                                            operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the
                                            economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in the
                                            country in which we operate.
                                        
                                    </p>

                                        The economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies,
                                        of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. If
                                        in the future such countryâ€™s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower
                                        rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries.
                                        A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and
                                        adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to
                                        consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial
                                        business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.
