                                            We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our
                                            directors and executive officers.

                                        We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent
                                        permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any
                                        right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust
                                        account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason
                                        whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be
                                        satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust
                                        account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to
                                        indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a
                                        lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duties.
                                        These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of
                                        derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an
                                        action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders.
                                        Furthermore, a shareholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent
                                        we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and
                                        directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
