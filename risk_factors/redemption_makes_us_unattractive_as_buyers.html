                                            The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may
                                            make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination
                                            targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business
                                            combination with a target.

                                        We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a
                                        prospective target that requires a certain amount of cash as a closing
                                        condition. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we
                                        would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be
                                        able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we
                                        redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets
                                        to be less than $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon completion of our
                                        initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s
                                        “penny stock” rules), or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that
                                        may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination.
                                        Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would
                                        cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either immediately
                                        prior to or upon completion of our initial business combination or less than
                                        such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above,
                                        we would not proceed with such redemption of our public shares and the related
                                        business combination, and we instead may search for an alternate business
                                        combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be
                                        reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.
