                                            Our officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses
                                            thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much
                                            time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a
                                            negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.

                                        our officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be
                                        entitled to substantial compensation and our officers are not obligated to
                                        contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent
                                        directors may also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If
                                        our officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote
                                        substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current
                                        commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs,
                                        which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business
                                        combination. For a complete discussion of our officers’ and directors’ other
