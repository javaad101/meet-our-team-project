                                            U.S. laws in the future may restrict or eliminate our ability to complete a
                                            business combination with certain companies.

                                        Future developments in U.S. laws may restrict our ability or willingness to
                                        complete certain business combinations with companies. For instance, the federal
                                        government has recently proposed legislation that would restrict our ability to
                                        consummate a business combination with a target business unless that business
                                        met certain standards of the PCAOB and would require delisting of a company from
                                        national securities exchanges if it failed to retain an accounting firm that the
                                        PCAOB has inspected to the satisfaction of the SEC. Such proposed legislation
                                        would also require public companies to disclose whether they are owned or
                                        controlled by a foreign government. We may not be able to consummate a business
                                        combination with a favored target business due to these laws. Furthermore, the
                                        documentation we may be required to submit to the SEC proving certain beneficial
                                        ownership requirements and establishing that we are not owned or controlled by a
                                        foreign government in the event that we use a foreign public accounting firm not
                                        subject to inspection by the PCAOB or where the PCAOB is unable to completely
                                        inspect or investigate our accounting practices or financial statements because
                                        of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction could be onerous
                                        and time consuming to prepare.
