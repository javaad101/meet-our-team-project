                                        Except as set forth above, we are not under any contractual obligation to engage
                                        any of the underwriters to provide any services for us after this offering, and
                                        have no present intent to do so. However, any of the underwriters may, among
                                        other things, introduce us to potential target businesses or assist us in
                                        raising additional capital, as needs may arise in the future. If any underwriter
                                        provides services to us after this offering, we may pay the underwriter fair and
                                        reasonable fees that would be determined at that time in an arm’s length
                                        negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with the
                                        underwriter and no fees for such services will be paid to the underwriter prior
                                        to the date which is 60 days after the date of this prospectus, unless FINRA
                                        determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriter’s compensation in
                                        connection with this offering.
