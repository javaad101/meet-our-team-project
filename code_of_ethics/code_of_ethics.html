<P><B>FORM OF CODE OF ETHICS</B></P>

<P><B>Effective [__________], 2021</B></P>

<P><B><U>I. INTRODUCTION</U></B></P>
<P>The Board of Directors (the &ldquo;<B><I>Board</I></B>&rdquo;) of Fortune Joy International Acquisition Corp has adopted this code of ethics (this &ldquo;<B><I>Code</I></B>&rdquo;), as amended from time to time by the Board and which is applicable to all of the Company&rsquo;s directors, officers and employees (to the extent that employees are hired in the future) (each a &ldquo;<B><I>person</I></B>,&rdquo; as used herein) of the Company (as defined below), to:</P>
<ul>
    <li>promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;</li>
    <li>promote the full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;<B><I>SEC</I></B>&rdquo;), as well as in other public communications made by or on behalf of the Company;</li>
    <li>promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;</li>
    <li>deter wrongdoing; and</li>
    <li>require prompt internal reporting of breaches of, and accountability for adherence to, this Code.</li>
</ul>
<P>This Code may be amended or modified by the Board. In this Code, references to the &ldquo;<B><I>Company</I></B>&rdquo; mean Fortune Joy International Acquisition Corp, in appropriate context, the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries, if any.</P>

<P><B><U>II. HONEST, ETHICAL AND FAIR CONDUCT</U></B></P>
<P>Each person owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest, fair and candid. Deceit, dishonesty and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity. Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain or advantage.</P>
<P>Each person must:</P>
<ul>
    <li>Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of the Company&rsquo;s information where required or when in the Company&rsquo;s interests;</li>
    <li>Observe all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;</li>
    <li>Comply with the requirements of applicable accounting and auditing standards, as well as Company policies, in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy and completeness in the Company&rsquo;s financial records and other business-related information and data;</li>
    <li>Adhere to a high standard of business ethics and not seek competitive advantage through unlawful or unethical business practices;</li>
    <li>Deal fairly with the Company&rsquo;s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees;</li>
    <li>Refrain from taking advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice;</li>
    <li>Protect the assets of the Company and ensure their proper use;</li>
    <li>Subject to, and except as permitted by, the Company&rsquo;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as it may be amended from time to time (the &ldquo;<B><I>charter</I></B>&rdquo;), not (i) take for themselves corporate or business opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position, (ii) use corporate property, information or position for personal gain and (iii) compete with the Company; and</li>
    <li>Avoid conflicts of interest, wherever possible, except as may be allowed under guidelines or resolutions approved by the Board (or the appropriate committee of the Board), as disclosed in the Company&rsquo;s public filings with the SEC or as permitted by the charter. Anything that would be a conflict for a person subject to this Code also will be a conflict for a member of his or her immediate family or any other close relative. Examples of conflict of interest situations include, but are not limited to, the following:
        <ul>
            <li>any significant ownership interest in any supplier or customer;</li>
            <li>any consulting or employment relationship with any supplier or customer;</li>
            <li>the receipt of any money, non-nominal gifts or excessive entertainment from any entity with which the Company has current or prospective business dealings;</li>
            <li>selling anything to the Company or buying anything from the Company, except on the same terms and conditions as comparable officers or directors are permitted to so purchase or sell;</li>
            <li>any other financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the Company; and</li>
            <li>any other circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of a person subject to this Code interferes &mdash; or even appears to interfere &mdash; with the interests of the Company as a whole.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<P><B><U>III. DISCLOSURE</U></B></P>
<P>The Company strives to ensure that the contents of and the disclosures in the reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and other public communications shall be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable in accordance with applicable disclosure standards, including standards of materiality, where appropriate. Each person must:</P>
<ul>
    <li>not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company, including to the Company&rsquo;s independent registered public accountants, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other governmental officials, as appropriate; and</li>
    <li>in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness.</li>
</ul>
<P>In addition to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (or persons performing similar functions), and each other person that typically is involved in the financial reporting of the Company, must familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company as well as the business and financial operations of the Company.</P>
<P>Each person must promptly bring to the attention of the Chairperson of the Board (the &ldquo;<B><I>Chairperson</I></B>&rdquo;) any information he or she may have concerning (a) significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal and/or disclosure controls that could adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data or (b) any fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company&rsquo;s financial reporting, disclosures or internal controls.</P>
