<p>THIS CERTIFIES THAT _________________________ is the owner of 
_________________________ Units of Fortune Joy International Acquisition
 Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “<b><i>Company</i></b>”), 
transferrable on the books of the Company in person or by duly 
authorized attorney upon surrender of this certificate properly

<p>Each Unit (<b><i>“Unit”</i></b>) consists of one (1) Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (<b><i>“Ordinary Share”</i></b>), of the Company and one redeemable warrant (<b><i>“Warrant”</i></b>).
 Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Ordinary Share 
(subject to adjustment) for $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). 
Each Warrant will become exercisable thirty (30) days after the 
Company’s completion of a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, 
share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination 
with one or more businesses (each a <b><i>“Business Combination”</i></b>),
 and will expire unless exercised before 5:00 p.m., New York City Time, 
on the date that is five (5) years after the date on which the Company 
completes its initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption 
or liquidation (the <b><i>“Expiration Date”</i></b>). The Ordinary 
Shares and Warrants comprising the Units represented by this certificate
 are not transferable separately prior to _________________________, 
202_, unless US Tiger Securities, Inc. and EF Hutton, division of 
Benchmark Investments, LLC, elect to allow separate trading earlier, 
subject to the Company’s filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K with the
 Securities and Exchange Commission containing an audited balance sheet 
reflecting the Company’s receipt of the gross proceeds of the Company’s 
initial public offering and issuing a press release announcing when 
separate trading will begin. No fractional Warrants will be issued upon 
separation of the Units. The terms of the Warrants are governed by a 
Warrant Agreement, dated as of _________________________, 202_ (the <b><i>“Warrant Agreement”</i></b>),
 between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company,
 as Warrant Agent, and are subject to the terms and provisions contained
 therein, all of which terms and provisions the holder of this 
certificate consents to by acceptance hereof. Copies of the Warrant 
Agreement are on file at the office of the Warrant Agent at 1 State 
Street, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004, and are available to any 
Warrant holder on written request and without cost.</p>

<p>Upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination, the Units 
represented by this certificate will automatically separate into the 
Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants comprising such Units. This 
certificate is not valid unless countersigned by the Transfer Agent and 
registered by the Registrar of the Company.</p>

<p>This certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance 
with the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to 
conflicts of laws principles thereof.</p>
