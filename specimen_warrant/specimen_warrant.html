<p align="CENTER"><b>FORTUNE JOY INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITION CORP</b></p>
<p align="RIGHT"><b>CUSIP</b> [...]</p>
<p align="CENTER"><b>WARRANT</b></p>
<br>

<p>THIS CERTIFIES THAT, for value received is the registered holder of a warrant or warrants (the “<u>Warrant(s)</u>”) of Fortune Joy International Acquisition Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “<u>Company</u>”),
 expiring at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the five year anniversary
 of the Company’s completion of an initial merger, capital stock 
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, 
reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more 
businesses or entities (a “<u>Business Combination</u>”), to purchase one fully paid and non-assessable Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (“<u>Shares</u>”),
 of the Company for each Warrant evidenced by this Warrant Certificate. 
The Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase from the Company, 
commencing 30 days after the Company’s completion of an initial Business
 Combination, such number of Shares of the Company at the Warrant Price 
(as defined below), upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate and 
payment of the Warrant Price at the office or agency of Continental 
Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company (the “<u>Warrant Agent</u>”), but 
only subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant 
Agreement, dated as of _______________, 202_, between the Company and 
Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company (the “<u>Warrant Agreement</u>”). In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant exercise. The term “<u>Warrant Price</u>”
 as used in this Warrant Certificate refers to the price per Share at 
which Shares may be purchased at the time the Warrant is exercised. The 
initial Warrant Price per Share is equal to $11.50 per share. The 
Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events 
the Warrant Price, the Redemption Trigger Price (as defined below) and 
the number of Shares purchasable hereunder, set forth on the face 
hereof, may, subject to certain conditions, be adjusted.</p>

<p>No fraction of a Share will be issued upon any exercise of a Warrant.
 If the holder of a Warrant would be entitled to receive a fraction of a
 Share upon any exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall, upon such 
exercise, round up to the nearest whole number the number of Shares to 
be issued to such holder.</p>

<p>This Warrant will expire on the date first referenced above if it is 
not exercised prior to such date by the registered holder pursuant to 
the terms of the Warrant Agreement or if it is not redeemed by the 
Company prior to such date.</p>

<p>Upon any exercise of the Warrant for less than the total number of 
full Shares provided for herein, there shall be issued to the registered
 holder hereof or the registered holder’s assignee a new Warrant 
Certificate covering the number of Shares for which the Warrant has not 
been exercised.</p>

<p>Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the office or agency of the
 Warrant Agent by the registered holder in person or by attorney duly 
authorized in writing, may be exchanged in the manner and subject to the
 limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, but without payment of 
any service charge, for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant 
Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the aggregate a like number
 of Warrants.</p>

<p>Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of the Warrant 
Certificate at the office or agency of the Warrant Agent, a new Warrant 
Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing in the 
aggregate a like number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee in
 exchange for this Warrant Certificate, subject to the limitations 
provided in the Warrant Agreement, without charge except for any 
applicable tax or other governmental charge.</p>

<p>The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the registered 
holder as the absolute owner of this Warrant Certificate 
(notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon made 
by anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution 
to the registered holder, and for all other purposes, and neither the 
Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the 
contrary.</p>

<p>This Warrant does not entitle the registered holder to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company.</p>

<p>The Company reserves the right to call the Warrant at any time prior 
to its exercise with a notice of call in writing to the holders of 
record of the Warrant, giving at least 30 days’ notice of such call, at 
any time while the Warrant is exercisable, if the last sale price of the
 Shares has been at least $16.50 per share (the “<u>Redemption Trigger Price</u>”) on each of 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period (the “<u>30-day trading period</u>”)
 ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of 
such call is given and if, and only if, there is a current registration 
statement in effect with respect to the Shares underlying the Warrants 
commencing five business days prior to the 30-day trading period and 
continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption. The call 
price of the Warrants is to be $0.01 per Warrant. Any Warrant either not
 exercised or tendered back to the Company by the end of the date 
specified in the notice of call shall be canceled on the books of the 
Company and have no further value except for the $0.01 call price.</p>
