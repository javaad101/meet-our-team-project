<p>Re: Administrative Services Agreement</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>

<p>This letter agreement by and between Fortune Joy International 
Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) and Fortune Joy Capital Corp (“Fortune 
Joy Capital”), dated as of the date hereof, will confirm our agreement 
that, commencing on the date the securities of the Company are first 
listed on The Nasdaq Global Market (the “Listing Date”), pursuant to a 
Registration Statement on Form S-1 and prospectus filed with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Registration Statement”) and 
continuing until the earlier of the consummation by the Company of an 
initial business combination or the Company’s liquidation (in each case 
as described in the Registration Statement) (such earlier date 
hereinafter referred to as the “Termination Date”):</p>

<p>(i) Fortune Joy Capital shall make available, or cause to be made 
available, to the Company, at 48 Bridge Street, Building A, Metuchen, NJ
 08840 (or any successor location of Fortune Joy Capital), certain 
office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support as 
may be reasonably required by the Company. In exchange therefor, the 
Company shall pay Fortune Joy Capital the sum of $10,000 per month on 
the Listing Date and continuing monthly thereafter until the Termination
 Date; and</p>

<p>(ii) Fortune Joy Capital hereby irrevocably waives any and all right,
 title, interest, causes of action and claims of any kind as a result 
of, or arising out of, this letter agreement (each, a “Claim”) in or to,
 and any and all right to seek payment of any amounts due to it out of, 
the trust account established for the benefit of the public stockholders
 of the Company and into which substantially all of the proceeds of the 
Company’s initial public offering will be deposited (the “Trust 
Account”) as a result of, or arising out of, this letter agreement, and 
hereby irrevocably waives any Claim it may have in the future, which 
Claim would reduce, encumber or otherwise adversely affect the Trust 
Account or any monies or other assets in the Trust Account, and further 
agrees not to seek recourse, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction of 
any Claim against the Trust Account or any monies or other assets in the
 Trust Account for any reason whatsoever.</p>

<p>This letter agreement constitutes the entire agreement and 
understanding of the parties hereto in respect of its subject matter and
 supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, or representations by 
or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate 
in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated
 hereby.</p>

<p>This letter agreement may not be amended, modified or waived as to 
any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by the
 parties hereto.</p>

<p>No party hereto may assign either this letter agreement or any of its
 rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written 
approval of the other party. Any purported assignment in violation of 
this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to 
transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee.</p>

<p>This letter agreement constitutes the entire relationship of the 
parties hereto, and any litigation between the parties (whether grounded
 in contract, tort, statute, law or equity) shall be governed by, 
construed in accordance with, and interpreted pursuant to the laws of 
the State of New York, without giving effect to its choice of law 
principles.</p>
