A holder of a Warrant may notify the Company in writing in the event it elects to be subject to the provisions contained in this&nbsp;<U>subsection
3.3.5</U>; however, no holder of a Warrant shall be subject to this&nbsp;<U>subsection 3.3.5&nbsp;</U>unless he, she or it makes such
election. If the election is made by a holder, the Warrant Agent shall not effect the exercise of the holder&rsquo;s Warrant, and such
holder shall not have the right to exercise such Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together
with such person&rsquo;s affiliates), to the Warrant Agent&rsquo;s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (the &ldquo;<U>Maximum
Percenta</U>ge&rdquo;) of the Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates shall include the number of Ordinary
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude
Ordinary Shares that would be issuable upon (x) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of the Warrant beneficially owned by such
person and its affiliates and (y) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company
beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates (including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred stock
or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;<U>Exchange Act</U>&rdquo;). For purposes of the Warrant, in determining the number of outstanding
Ordinary Shares, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares as reflected in (1) the Company&rsquo;s most recent
annual report on Form 10- K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC as the case
may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (3) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth
the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written request of the holder of the Warrant, the Company
shall, within two (2) Business Days, confirm orally and in writing to such holder the number of Ordinary Shares then outstanding. In any
case, the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of equity securities
of the Company by the holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding Ordinary Shares was reported. By
written notice to the Company, the holder of a Warrant may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage applicable to
such holder to any other percentage specified in such notice; provided, however, that any such increase shall not be effective until the
sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company.</P>

does not exceed $0.50 per share (taking into account all of the outstanding shares of the Company at such time (whether or not any shareholders
waived their right to receive such dividend) and as adjusted to appropriately reflect any of the events referred to in other subsections
of this&nbsp;<U>Section 4</U>&nbsp;and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the Warrant Price

the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Act, of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and
it shall use its best efforts to take such action as is necessary to register or qualify for sale, in those states in which the Warrants
were initially offered by the Company and in those states where holders of Warrants then reside, the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants, to the extent an exemption is not available. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective

of this Agreement. If any such registration statement has not been declared effective by the 60th Business Day following the closing of
the Business Combination, holders of the Warrants shall have the right, during the period beginning on the 61st Business Day after the
closing of the Business Combination and ending upon such registration statement being declared effective by the SEC, and during any other

law experience) stating that (i) the exercise of the Warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with this&nbsp;<U>Section 7.4</U>&nbsp;is
not required to be registered under the Act and (ii) the Ordinary Shares issued upon such exercise will be freely tradable under U.S.
federal securities laws by anyone who is not an affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Act) of the Company and, accordingly,
will not be required to bear a restrictive legend. For the avoidance of any doubt, unless and until all of the Warrants have been exercised
on a cashless basis, the Company shall continue to be obligated to comply with its registration obligations under the first three sentences
of this&nbsp;<U>Section 7.4</U>. The provisions of this Section 7.4 may not be modified, amended, or deleted without the prior written
