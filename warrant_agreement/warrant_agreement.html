<p><b>Exhibit 4.4</b></p>

<p align="CENTER"><b>WARRANT AGREEMENT</b></p>

<p>This agreement (“<u>Agreement</u>”) is made as of [...], 2022 between Fortune Joy International Acquisition Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“<u>Company</u>”), and Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, a limited purpose trust company, as warrant agent (the “<u>Warrant Agent</u>”, also referred to herein as the “<u>Transfer Agent</u>”).</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Company is engaged in a public offering (“<u>Public Offering</u>”) of up to 7,500,000 units (including up to 8,625,000 units subject to the Over-allotment Option (as defined below)) (“<u>Units</u>”), each Unit comprised of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“<u>Ordinary Shares</u>”),
 and one redeemable warrant, where each warrant entitles the holder to 
purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to 
adjustment as described herein, and, in connection therewith, will issue
 and deliver up to 3,750,000 warrants (including up to 4,312,500 
warrants subject to the Over-allotment Option) (the “<u>Public Warrants</u>”) to the public investors in connection with the Public Offering; and</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “<u>SEC</u>”) a Registration Statement on Form S-1, File No. 333-[...] (“<u>Registration Statement</u>”), and a prospectus (the “<u>Prospectus</u>”) for the registration, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“<u>Act</u>”), of the Units, the Public Warrants and the Ordinary Shares included in the Units; and</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Company has received binding commitments from Fortune Joy Capital Corp (the “<u>Sponsor</u>”)
 to purchase up to an aggregate of 465,000 units (up to 510,000 units if
 the Over-allotment Option is exercised in full) (the “<u>Private Units</u>”)
 at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, in a private placement 
transaction to occur simultaneously with the consummation of the Public 
Offering, and, in connection therewith, will issue and deliver up to an 
aggregate of 232,500 warrants (up to 255,000 warrants if the 
Over-allotment Option is exercised in full) underlying such Private 
Units bearing the legend set forth in <u>Exhibit B</u> hereto (the “<u>Private Warrants</u>,” and together with the Public Warrants, the “<u>Warrants</u>”).</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> in order to finance the Company’s transaction costs 
in connection with an intended initial Business Combination (as defined 
below), the Sponsor or affiliates of the Sponsor or certain of the 
Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the
 Company funds as the Company may require, of which up to $1,500,000 of 
such loans may be convertible into up to an additional 150,000 Private 
Units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “<u>Working Capital Units</u>”), and, in connection therewith, will issue and deliver up to an aggregate of 75,000 warrants (the “<u>Working Capital Warrants</u>” and, together with the Private Warrants and Public Warrants, the “<u>Warrants</u>”); and</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Company desires the Warrant Agent to act on 
behalf of the Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing to so act, in 
connection with the issuance, registration, transfer, exchange, 
redemption, and exercise of the Warrants; and</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Company desires to provide for the form and 
provisions of the Warrants, the terms upon which they shall be issued 
and exercised, and the respective rights, limitation of rights, and 
immunities of the Company, the Warrant Agent, and the holders of the 
Warrants; and</p>

<p><b>WHEREAS,</b> all acts and things have been done and performed 
which are necessary to make the Warrants, when executed on behalf of the
 Company and countersigned by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent, as 
provided herein, the valid, binding, and legal obligations of the 
Company, and to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement.</p>

<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>

<p>1. <u>Appointment of Warrant Agent</u>. The Company hereby appoints 
the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company for the Warrants, and 
the Warrant Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform 
the same in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this 
Agreement.</p>

<p>2. <u>Warrants</u>.</p>
    <p>2.1. <u>Form of Warrant</u>. Each Warrant shall be issued in registered form only, shall be in substantially the form of <u>Exhibit A</u>
 hereto, the provisions of which are incorporated herein and shall be 
signed by, or bear the facsimile signature of, the Chairman of the Board
 of Directors or Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and 
shall bear a facsimile of the Company’s seal. In the event the person 
whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any Warrant shall have 
ceased to serve in the capacity in which such person signed the Warrant 
before such Warrant is issued, it may be issued with the same effect as 
if he or she had not ceased to be such at the date of issuance.</p>
    <p>2.2. <u>Uncertificated Warrants</u>. Notwithstanding anything 
herein to the contrary, any Warrant, or portion thereof, may be issued 
as part of, and be represented by, a Unit, and any Warrant may be issued
 in uncertificated or book-entry form through the Warrant Agent and/or 
the facilities of The Depository Trust Company or other book-entry 
depositary system, in each case as determined by the Board of Directors 
of the Company or by an authorized committee thereof. Any Warrant so 
issued shall have the same terms, force and effect as a certificated 
Warrant that has been duly countersigned by the Warrant Agent in 
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>2.3. <u>Effect of Countersignature</u>. Except with respect to 
uncertificated Warrants as described above, unless and until 
countersigned by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Warrant
 shall be invalid and of no effect and may not be exercised by the 
holder thereof.</p>
    <p>2.4. <u>Registration</u>.</p>
        <p>2.4.1. <u>Warrant Register</u>. The Warrant Agent shall maintain books (“<u>Warrant Register</u>”)
 for the registration of original issuance and the registration of 
transfer of the Warrants. Upon the initial issuance of the Warrants, the
 Warrant Agent shall issue and register the Warrants in the names of the
 respective holders thereof in such denominations and otherwise in 
accordance with instructions delivered to the Warrant Agent by the 
Company.</p>
        <p>2.4.2. <u>Registered Holder</u>. Prior to due presentment for
 registration of transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant 
Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name such Warrant is then 
registered in the Warrant Register (“<u>registered holder</u>”) as the 
absolute owner of such Warrant and of each Warrant represented thereby 
(notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing on the 
Warrant certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Warrant
 Agent), for the purpose of any exercise thereof, and for all other 
purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be 
affected by any notice to the contrary.</p>
    <p>2.5. <u>Detachability of Warrants</u>. The securities comprising 
the Units will not be separately transferable until the 52nd business 
day following the date of the Prospectus or, if such 52nd business day 
is not on a day, other than Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, on 
which banks in New York City are generally open for normal business (a “<u>Business Day</u>”),
 then on the immediately succeeding Business Day following such date, or
 earlier with the consent of Tiger Brokers and EF Hutton, division of 
Benchmark Investments, LLC (the “<u>Representatives</u>”), but in no 
event will the Representatives allow separate trading of the securities 
comprising the Units until (i) the Company has filed a Current Report on
 Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet reflecting the receipt
 by the Company of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering including 
the proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of the 
underwriters’ over-allotment option in the Public Offering (the “<u>Over-allotment Option</u>”),
 if the Over-allotment Option is exercised prior to the filing of the 
Form 8-K, and (ii) the Company has issued a press release announcing 
when such separate trading shall begin (the “<u>Detachment Date</u>”); provided that no fractional Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Warrants will trade.</p>
    <p>2.6. <u>Private Warrant and Working Capital Warrant Attributes</u>. The Private Warrants and Working Capital Warrants will be issued in the same form as the Public Warrants.</p>

<p>3. <u>Terms and Exercise of Warrants</u></p>
    <p>3.1. <u>Warrant Price</u>. Each Warrant shall, when countersigned
 by the Warrant Agent (except with respect to uncertificated Warrants), 
entitle the registered holder thereof, subject to the provisions of such
 Warrant and of this Agreement, to purchase from the Company the number 
of Ordinary Shares stated therein, at the price of $11.50 per share, 
subject to the adjustments provided in <u>Section 4</u> hereof and in the last sentence of this <u>Section 3.1</u>.
 The term “Warrant Price” as used in this Agreement refers to the price 
per share at which the Ordinary Shares may be purchased at the time a 
Warrant is exercised. The Company in its sole discretion may lower the 
Warrant Price at any time prior to the Expiration Date (as defined 
below) for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business Days; 
provided, that the Company shall provide at least twenty (20) days’ 
prior written notice of such reduction to registered holders of the 
Warrants and, provided further that any such reduction shall be applied 
consistently to all of the Warrants.</p>
    <p>3.2. <u>Duration of Warrants</u>. A Warrant may be exercised only
 during the period commencing on 30 days after the consummation by the 
Company of a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, 
recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination 
with one or more businesses or entities (“<u>Business Combination</u>”) 
(as described more fully in the Registration Statement) and terminating 
at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the earlier to occur of (i) five 
years from the consummation of a Business Combination, (ii) the 
Redemption Date as provided in <u>Section 6.2</u> of this Agreement and (iii) the liquidation of the Company (“<u>Expiration Date</u>”),
 provided, however, that the Warrants issued to the Representatives will
 not be exercisable more than five years after the commencement of sales
 in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8). The period of time from the 
date the Warrants will first become exercisable until the expiration of 
the Warrants shall hereafter be referred to as the “<u>Exercise Period</u>.” Except with respect to the right to receive the Redemption Price (as set forth in <u>Section 6</u>
 hereunder), as applicable, each Warrant not exercised on or before the 
Expiration Date shall become void, and all rights thereunder and all 
rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease at 5:00 p.m.,
 New York City time, on the Expiration Date. The Company in its sole 
discretion may extend the duration of the Warrants by delaying the 
Expiration Date; provided, however, that the Company will provide at 
least twenty (20) days’ prior written notice of any such extension to 
registered holders and, provided further that any such extension shall 
be applied consistently to all of the Warrants.</p>
    <p>3.3. <u>Exercise of Warrants</u>.</p>
        <p>3.3.1. <u>Payment</u>. Subject to the provisions of the 
Warrant and this Agreement, a Warrant, when countersigned by the Warrant
 Agent, may be exercised by the registered holder thereof by 
surrendering it, at the office of the Warrant Agent, or at the office of
 its successor as Warrant Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, City and 
State of New York, with the subscription form, as set forth in the 
Warrant, duly executed, and by paying in full the Warrant Price for each
 full Ordinary Share as to which the Warrant is exercised and any and 
all applicable taxes due in connection with the exercise of the Warrant,
 the exchange of the Warrant for the Ordinary Shares and the issuance of
 such Ordinary Shares, as follows:</p>
            <p>(a) in lawful money of the United States, by good certified check or wire payable to the Warrant Agent; or</p>
            <p>(b) in the event of redemption pursuant to <u>Section 6</u>
 hereof in which the Company’s management has elected to force all 
holders of Warrants to exercise such Warrants on a “cashless basis,” by 
surrendering the Warrants for that number of Ordinary Shares equal to 
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of 
Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference 
between the Warrant Price and the “Fair Market Value” (defined below) by
 (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this <u>Section 3.3.1(b)</u>,
 the “Fair Market Value” shall mean the volume-weighted average last 
reported sale price of the Ordinary Shares for the ten (10) trading days
 ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice 
of redemption is sent to the holders of Warrants pursuant to <u>Section 6</u> hereof; or</p>
            <p>(c) in the event the registration statement required by <u>Section 7.4</u>
 hereof is not effective and current within sixty (60) Business Days 
after the closing of a Business Combination, by surrendering such 
Warrants for that number of Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient 
obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Ordinary Shares 
underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the 
Warrant Price and the “Fair Market Value” by (y) the Fair Market Value; 
provided, however, that no cashless exercise shall be permitted unless 
the Fair Market Value is equal to or higher than the exercise price. 
Solely for purposes of this <u>Section 3.3.1(c)</u>, the “Fair Market 
Value” shall mean the volume-weighted average last reported sale price 
of the Ordinary Shares for the ten (10) trading days ending on the third
 trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise of the 
Warrant is sent to the Warrant Agent.</p>
        <p>3.3.2. <u>Issuance of Ordinary Shares</u>. As soon as 
practicable after the exercise of any Warrant and the clearance of the 
funds in payment of the Warrant Price (if any), the Company shall issue 
to the registered holder of such Warrant a certificate or certificates, 
or book entry position, for the number of Ordinary Shares to which he, 
she or it is entitled, registered in such name or names as may be 
directed by him, her or it, and if such Warrant shall not have been 
exercised in full, a new countersigned Warrant, or book entry position, 
for the number of shares as to which such Warrant shall not have been 
exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Company 
be required to net cash settle the Warrant exercise. No Warrant shall be
 exercisable for cash and the Company shall not be obligated to issue 
Ordinary Shares upon exercise of a Warrant unless the Ordinary Shares 
issuable upon such Warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or 
deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence 
of the registered holder of the Warrants. In the event that the 
condition in the immediately preceding sentence is not satisfied with 
respect to a Warrant, the holder of such Warrant shall not be entitled 
to exercise such Warrant for cash and such Warrant may have no value and
 expire worthless, in which case the purchaser of a Unit containing such
 Public Warrants shall have paid the full purchase price for the Unit 
solely for the Ordinary Shares underlying such Unit. Warrants may not be
 exercised by, or securities issued to, any registered holder in any 
state in which such exercise would be unlawful.</p>
        <p>3.3.3. <u>Valid Issuance</u>. All Ordinary Shares issued upon
 the proper exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement 
shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.</p>
        <p>3.3.4. <u>Date of Issuance</u>. Each person in whose name any
 book entry position or certificate for Ordinary Shares is issued shall 
for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such 
shares on the date on which the Warrant, or book entry position 
representing such Warrant, was surrendered and payment of the Warrant 
Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such 
certificate, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a
 date when the share transfer books of the Company or book entry system 
of the Warrant Agent are closed, such person shall be deemed to have 
become the holder of such shares at the close of business on the next 
succeeding date on which the share transfer books or book entry system 
are open.</p>
        <p>3.3.5. <u>Maximum Percentage</u>. A holder of a Warrant may 
notify the Company in writing in the event it elects to be subject to 
the provisions contained in this <u>subsection 3.3.5</u>; however, no holder of a Warrant shall be subject to this <u>subsection 3.3.5</u>
 unless he, she or it makes such election. If the election is made by a 
holder, the Warrant Agent shall not effect the exercise of the holder’s 
Warrant, and such holder shall not have the right to exercise such 
Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such 
person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the Warrant Agent’s 
actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (the “<u>Maximum Percentage</u>”)
 of the Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to 
such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate 
number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by such person and its 
affiliates shall include the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon 
exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the determination of such 
sentence is being made, but shall exclude Ordinary Shares that would be 
issuable upon (x) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of the 
Warrant beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and (y) 
exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any 
other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such person and 
its affiliates (including, without limitation, any convertible notes or 
convertible preferred stock or warrants) subject to a limitation on 
conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. 
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this 
paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with 
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “<u>Exchange Act</u>”).
 For purposes of the Warrant, in determining the number of outstanding 
Ordinary Shares, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding 
Ordinary Shares as reflected in (1) the Company’s most recent annual 
report on Form 10- K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current report on 
Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC as the case may be, (2) a 
more recent public announcement by the Company or (3) any other notice 
by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of 
Ordinary Shares outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the 
written request of the holder of the Warrant, the Company shall, within 
two (2) Business Days, confirm orally and in writing to such holder the 
number of Ordinary Shares then outstanding. In any case, the number of 
outstanding Ordinary Shares shall be determined after giving effect to 
the conversion or exercise of equity securities of the Company by the 
holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of 
outstanding Ordinary Shares was reported. By written notice to the 
Company, the holder of a Warrant may from time to time increase or 
decrease the Maximum Percentage applicable to such holder to any other 
percentage specified in such notice; provided, however, that any such 
increase shall not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after 
such notice is delivered to the Company.</p>

<p>4. <u>Adjustments</u>.</p>
    <p>4.1. <u>Stock Dividends; Split Ups</u>. If after the date hereof, and subject to the provisions of <u>Section 4.6</u>
 below, the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares is increased by a 
stock dividend payable in Ordinary Shares, or by a split up of Ordinary 
Shares, or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such 
stock dividend, split up or similar event, the number of Ordinary Shares
 issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion 
to such increase in outstanding Ordinary Shares.</p>
    <p>4.2. <u>Aggregation of Shares</u>. If after the date hereof, the 
number of outstanding Ordinary Shares is decreased by a consolidation, 
combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of Ordinary Shares 
or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such 
consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or 
similar event, the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of 
each Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in 
outstanding Ordinary Shares.</p>
    <p>4.3. <u>Extraordinary Dividends</u>. If the Company, at any time 
while the Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, shall pay a dividend 
or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the 
holders of the Ordinary Shares or other shares of the Company’s capital 
stock into which the Warrants are convertible (an “<u>Extraordinary Dividend</u>”),
 then the Warrant Price shall be decreased, effective immediately after 
the effective date of such Extraordinary Dividend, by the amount of cash
 and the fair market value (as determined by the Company’s Board of 
Directors, in good faith) of any securities or other assets paid in 
respect of such Extraordinary Dividend divided by all outstanding shares
 of the Company at such time (whether or not any shareholders waived 
their right to receive such dividend); provided, however, that none of 
the following shall be deemed an Extraordinary Dividend for purposes of 
this provision: (a) any adjustment described in <u>subsection 4.1</u> 
above, (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined
 on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash 
distributions paid on the Ordinary Shares during the 365- day period 
ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution does 
not exceed $0.50 per share (taking into account all of the outstanding 
shares of the Company at such time (whether or not any shareholders 
waived their right to receive such dividend) and as adjusted to 
appropriately reflect any of the events referred to in other subsections
 of this <u>Section 4</u> and excluding cash dividends or cash 
distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the Warrant Price or to 
the number of Ordinary Shares issuable on exercise of each Warrant) but 
only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash 
distributions equal to or less than $0.50, (c) any payment to satisfy 
the conversion rights of the holders of the Ordinary Shares in 
connection with a proposed initial Business Combination or certain 
amendments to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles
 of Association (as described in the Registration Statement) or (d) any 
payment in connection with the Company’s liquidation and the 
distribution of its assets upon its failure to consummate a Business 
Combination. Solely for purposes of illustration, if the Company, at a 
time while the Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pays a cash 
dividend of $0.35 and previously paid an aggregate of $0.40 of cash 
dividends and cash distributions on the Ordinary Shares during the 
365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such $0.35 dividend,
 then the Warrant Price will be decreased, effectively immediately after
 the effective date of such $0.35 dividend, by $0.25 (the absolute value
 of the difference between $0.75 (the aggregate amount of all cash 
dividends and cash distributions paid or made in such 365-day period, 
including such $0.35 dividend) and $0.50 (the greater of (x) $0.50 and 
(y) the aggregate amount of all cash dividends and cash distributions 
paid or made in such 365-day period prior to such $0.35 dividend)).</p>
    <p>4.4. <u>Adjustments in Exercise Price</u>. Whenever the number of Ordinary Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided in <u>Sections 4.1</u> and <u>4.2</u>
 above, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by 
multiplying such Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a
 fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of Ordinary 
Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants immediately prior 
to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number
 of Ordinary Shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.</p>
    <p>4.5. <u>Replacement of Securities upon Reorganization, etc</u>. In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Ordinary Shares (other than a change covered by <u>Section 4.1</u>, <u>4.2</u> or <u>4.3</u>
 hereof or that solely affects the par value of the Ordinary Shares), or
 in the case of any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into 
another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the 
Company is the continuing corporation and that does not result in any 
reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Ordinary Shares), 
or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or 
entity of the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or 
substantially as an entirety in connection with which the Company is 
dissolved, the Warrant holders shall thereafter have the right to 
purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions 
specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the Ordinary Shares of the 
Company immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the 
exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of 
shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) 
receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or 
consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or 
transfer, that the Warrant holder would have received if such Warrant 
holder had exercised his, her or its Warrant(s) immediately prior to 
such event. If any reclassification also results in a change in the 
Ordinary Shares covered by <u>Section 4.1</u>, <u>4.2</u> or <u>4.3</u>, then such adjustment shall be made pursuant to <u>Sections 4.1</u>, <u>4.2</u>, <u>4.3</u>, <u>4.4</u> and this <u>Section 4.5</u>. The provisions of this <u>Section 4.5</u>
 shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations,
 mergers or consolidations, sales or other transfers. In no event will 
the Warrant Price be reduced to less than the par value per share 
issuable upon exercise of the Warrant.</p>
    <p>4.6. <u>Issuance in connection with a Business Combination</u>. 
If, in connection with a Business Combination, the Company (a) issues 
additional Ordinary Shares or equity-linked securities at an issue price
 or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share (with such issue 
price or effective issue price as determined by the Company’s Board of 
Directors, in good faith, and in the case of any such issuance to the 
Sponsor, the initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking 
into account any shares of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares, par 
value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Ordinary Shares”), issued prior to
 the Public Offering and held by the initial stockholders or their 
affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued 
Price”), (b) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent 
more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, 
available for the funding of the Business Combination on the date of the
 consummation of such Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (c)
 the Market Value (as defined below) is below $9.20 per share, then the 
exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to
 be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) Newly 
Issued Price, and the Redemption Trigger Price (as defined below) will 
be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the greater of 
(i) the Market Value or (ii) the Newly Issued Price. Solely for purposes
 of this <u>Section 4.6</u>, the “Market Value” shall mean the volume 
weighted average trading price of the Ordinary Shares during the twenty 
(20) trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the date of
 the consummation of the Business Combination.</p>
    <p>4.7. <u>Notices of Changes in Warrant</u>. Upon every adjustment 
of the Warrant Price or the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a
 Warrant, the Company shall give written notice thereof to the Warrant 
Agent, which notice shall state the Warrant Price resulting from such 
adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any, in the number of shares
 purchasable at such price upon the exercise of a Warrant, setting forth
 in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which
 such calculation is based. Upon the occurrence of any event specified 
in <u>Sections 4.1</u>, <u>4.2</u>, <u>4.3</u>, <u>4.4</u>, <u>4.5</u>, or <u>4.6</u>,
 then, in any such event, the Company shall give written notice to each 
Warrant holder, at the last address set forth for such holder in the 
Warrant Register, of the record date or the effective date of the event.
 Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect 
the legality or validity of such event.</p>
    <p>4.8. <u>No Fractional Warrants or Shares</u>. Notwithstanding any
 provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company 
shall not issue fractional shares upon exercise of Warrants. If, by 
reason of any adjustment made pursuant to this <u>Section 4</u>, the 
holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such 
Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company shall,
 upon such exercise, round up to the nearest whole number of Ordinary 
Shares to be issued to the Warrant holder.</p>
    <p>4.9. <u>Form of Warrant</u>. The form of Warrant need not be changed because of any adjustment pursuant to this <u>Section 4</u>,
 and Warrants issued after such adjustment may state the same Warrant 
Price and the same number of shares as is stated in the Warrants 
initially issued pursuant to this Agreement. However, the Company may at
 any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant 
that the Company may deem appropriate and that does not affect the 
substance thereof, and any Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, 
whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant or 
otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.</p>
    <p>4.10. <u>Other Events</u>. In case any event shall occur affecting the Company as to which none of the provisions of preceding subsections of this <u>Section 4</u>
 are strictly applicable, but which would require an adjustment to the 
terms of the Warrants in order to (i) avoid an adverse impact on the 
Warrants and (ii) effectuate the intent and purpose of this <u>Section 4</u>,
 then, in each such case, the Company shall appoint a firm of 
independent public accountants, investment banking or other appraisal 
firm of recognized national standing, which shall give its opinion as to
 whether or not any adjustment to the rights represented by the Warrants
 is necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this <u>Section 4</u>
 and, if they determine that an adjustment is necessary, the terms of 
such adjustment. The Company shall adjust the terms of the Warrants in a
 manner that is consistent with any adjustment recommended in such 
opinion.</p>
    <p>4.11. <u>No Adjustment</u>. For the avoidance of doubt, no 
adjustment shall be made to the terms of the Warrants solely as a result
 of an adjustment to the conversion ratio of the Class B Ordinary Shares
 into Ordinary Shares or the conversion of the shares of Class B 
Ordinary Shares into shares of Ordinary Shares, in each case, pursuant 
to the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of 
Association, as further amended from time to time.</p>

<p>5. <u>Transfer and Exchange of Warrants</u>.</p>
    <p>5.1. <u>Registration of Transfer</u>. The Warrant Agent shall 
register the transfer, from time to time, of any outstanding Warrant 
upon the Warrant Register, upon surrender of such Warrant for transfer, 
properly endorsed with signatures, in the case of certificated Warrants,
 properly guaranteed and accompanied by appropriate instructions for 
transfer. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant representing an equal 
aggregate number of Warrants shall be issued and the old Warrant shall 
be canceled by the Warrant Agent. In the case of certificated Warrants, 
the Warrants so canceled shall be delivered by the Warrant Agent to the 
Company from time to time upon request.</p>
    <p>5.2. <u>Procedure for Surrender of Warrants</u>. Warrants may be 
surrendered to the Warrant Agent, either in certificated form or in book
 entry position, together with a written request for exchange or 
transfer, and thereupon the Warrant Agent shall issue in exchange 
therefor one or more new Warrants, or book entry positions, as requested
 by the registered holder of the Warrants so surrendered, representing 
an equal aggregate number of Warrants; provided, however, that in the 
event that a Warrant surrendered for transfer bears a restrictive 
legend, the Warrant Agent shall not cancel such Warrant and issue new 
Warrants in exchange therefor until the Warrant Agent has received an 
opinion of counsel for the Company stating that such transfer may be 
made and indicating whether the new Warrants must also bear a 
restrictive legend.</p>
    <p>5.3. <u>Fractional Warrants</u>. The Warrant Agent shall not be 
required to effect any registration of transfer or exchange which will 
result in the issuance of a warrant certificate or book-entry position 
for a fraction of a warrant, except as part of the Units.</p>
    <p>5.4. <u>Service Charges</u>. No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrants.</p>
    <p>5.5. <u>Warrant Execution and Countersignature</u>. The Warrant 
Agent is hereby authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance 
with the terms of this Agreement, the Warrants required to be issued 
pursuant to the provisions of this <u>Section 5</u>, and the Company, 
whenever required by the Warrant Agent, will supply the Warrant Agent 
with Warrants duly executed on behalf of the Company for such purpose.</p>
    <p>5.6. <u>Private Warrants and Working Capital Warrants</u>. The 
Warrant Agent shall not register any transfer of Private Warrants or 
Working Capital Warrants until after the consummation by the Company of 
an initial Business Combination, except for transfers (i) among the 
initial stockholders or (x) in the case of the Representatives, to 
Representatives’ affiliates, or any investment fund or other entity 
controlled or managed by the Representatives, or to any investment 
manager or investment advisor of the Representatives or an affiliate of 
any such investment manager or investment advisor or to any investment 
fund or other entity controlled or managed by such persons and (y) to 
the Company’s or the initial stockholders’ members, officers, directors,
 consultants or their affiliates, any affiliate of the Representatives 
or any employee of the Representatives, or any member of the 
Representatives or any affiliate of such member, (ii) to a holder’s 
stockholders or members upon the holder’s liquidation, in each case if 
the holder is an entity, (iii) by bona fide gift to a member of the 
holder’s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is the
 holder or a member of the holder’s immediate family, in each case for 
estate planning purposes, (iv) by virtue of the laws of descent and 
distribution upon death, (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations 
order, (vi) to the Company for no value for cancellation in connection 
with the consummation of a Business Combination, (vii) in connection 
with the consummation of a Business Combination at prices no greater 
than the price at which the Warrants were originally purchased, (viii) 
in the event of the Company’s liquidation prior to its consummation of 
an initial Business Combination or (ix) in the event that, subsequent to
 the consummation of an initial Business Combination, the Company 
completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar
 transaction which results in all of the Company’s stockholders having 
the right to exchange their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or 
other property, in each case (except for clauses (vi), (viii) or (ix) or
 with the Company’s prior written consent) on the condition that prior 
to such registration for transfer, the Warrant Agent shall be presented 
with written documentation pursuant to which each transferee (each, a “<u>Permitted Transferee</u>”)
 or the trustee or legal guardian for such Permitted Transferee agrees 
to be bound by the transfer restrictions contained in this Agreement and
 any other applicable agreement the transferor is bound by.</p>
    <p>5.7. <u>Transfers prior to Detachment</u>. Prior to the 
Detachment Date, the Public Warrants may be transferred or exchanged 
only together with the Unit in which such Warrant is included, and only 
for the purpose of effecting, or in conjunction with, a transfer or 
exchange of such Unit. Furthermore, each transfer of a Unit on the 
register relating to such Units shall also operate to transfer the 
Warrants included in such Unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 
provisions of this <u>Section 5.7</u> shall have no effect on any transfer of Warrants on or after the Detachment Date.</p>

<p>6. <u>Redemption</u>.</p>
    <p>6.1. <u>Redemption</u>. Not less than all of the outstanding 
Warrants may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, at any time 
during the Exercise Period, at the office of the Warrant Agent, upon the
 notice referred to in <u>Section 6.2</u>, at the price of $0.01 per Warrant (“<u>Redemption Price</u>”),
 provided that the last sales price of the Ordinary Shares equals or 
exceeds $16.50 per share (subject to adjustment in accordance with <u>Section 4</u> hereof) (the “<u>Redemption Trigger Price</u>”),
 on each of twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day 
period commencing after the Warrants become exercisable and ending on 
the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is
 given and provided that there is an effective registration statement 
covering the Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and
 a current prospectus relating thereto, available throughout the 30-day 
redemption or the Company has elected to require the exercise of the 
Warrants on a “cashless basis” pursuant to <u>subsection 3.3.1(b)</u>; 
provided, however, that if and when the Public Warrants become 
redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise such redemption 
right if the issuance of Ordinary Shares upon exercise of the Public 
Warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under 
applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such 
registration or qualification.</p>
    <p>6.2. <u>Date Fixed for, and Notice of, Redemption</u>. In the 
event the Company shall elect to redeem all of the Warrants that are 
subject to redemption, the Company shall fix a date for the redemption 
(the “<u>Redemption Date</u>”). Notice of redemption shall be mailed by 
first class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than thirty 
(30) days prior to the Redemption Date to the registered holders of the 
Warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they shall appear on 
the registration books. Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided 
shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not 
the registered holder received such notice.</p>
    <p>6.3. <u>Exercise After Notice of Redemption</u>. The Warrants may be exercised, for cash (or on a “cashless basis” in accordance with <u>Section 3</u> of this Agreement) at any time after notice of redemption shall have been given by the Company pursuant to <u>Section 6.2</u>
 hereof and prior to the Redemption Date. In the event the Company 
determines to require all holders of Warrants to exercise their Warrants
 on a “cashless basis” pursuant to <u>Section 3.3.1(b)</u>, the notice 
of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the 
number of Ordinary Shares to be received upon exercise of the Warrants, 
including the “Fair Market Value” in such case. On and after the 
Redemption Date, the record holder of the Warrants shall have no further
 rights except to receive, upon surrender of the Warrants, the 
Redemption Price.</p>

<p>7. <u>Other Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants</u>.</p>
    <p>7.1. <u>No Rights as Stockholder</u>. A Warrant does not entitle 
the registered holder thereof to any of the rights of a stockholder of 
the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive 
dividends, or other distributions, exercise any preemptive rights to 
vote or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in respect of 
the meetings of stockholders or the election of directors of the Company
 or any other matter.</p>
    <p>7.2. <u>Lost, Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants</u>. If 
any Warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company and 
the Warrant Agent may on such terms as to indemnity or otherwise as they
 may in their discretion impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated
 Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new Warrant of like 
denomination, tenor, and date as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated,
 or destroyed. Any such new Warrant shall constitute a substitute 
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the allegedly 
lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall be at any time 
enforceable by anyone.</p>
    <p>7.3. <u>Reservation of Ordinary Shares</u>. The Company shall at 
all times reserve and keep available a number of its authorized but 
unissued Ordinary Shares that will be sufficient to permit the exercise 
in full of all outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
    <p>7.4. <u>Registration of Ordinary Shares</u>. The Company agrees 
that as soon as practicable after the closing of its initial Business 
Combination, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
 the closing of its initial Business Combination, it shall use its best 
efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the 
registration, under the Act, of the Ordinary Shares issuable upon 
exercise of the Warrants, and it shall use its best efforts to take such
 action as is necessary to register or qualify for sale, in those states
 in which the Warrants were initially offered by the Company and in 
those states where holders of Warrants then reside, the Ordinary Shares 
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, to the extent an exemption is 
not available. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same 
to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such 
registration statement until the expiration of the Warrants in 
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If any such 
registration statement has not been declared effective by the 60th 
Business Day following the closing of the Business Combination, holders 
of the Warrants shall have the right, during the period beginning on the
 61st Business Day after the closing of the Business Combination and 
ending upon such registration statement being declared effective by the 
SEC, and during any other period when the Company shall fail to have 
maintained an effective registration statement covering the Ordinary 
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, to exercise such Warrants
 on a “cashless basis” as determined in accordance with <u>Section 3.3.1(c)</u>.
 The Company shall provide the Warrant Agent with an opinion of counsel 
for the Company (which shall be an outside law firm with securities law 
experience) stating that (i) the exercise of the Warrants on a cashless 
basis in accordance with this <u>Section 7.4</u> is not required to be 
registered under the Act and (ii) the Ordinary Shares issued upon such 
exercise will be freely tradable under U.S. federal securities laws by 
anyone who is not an affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144 
under the Act) of the Company and, accordingly, will not be required to 
bear a restrictive legend. For the avoidance of any doubt, unless and 
until all of the Warrants have been exercised on a cashless basis, the 
Company shall continue to be obligated to comply with its registration 
obligations under the first three sentences of this <u>Section 7.4</u>. 
The provisions of this Section 7.4 may not be modified, amended, or 
deleted without the prior written consent of the Representatives.</p>

<p>8. <u>Concerning the Warrant Agent and Other Matters</u>.</p>
    <p>8.1. <u>Payment of Taxes</u>. The Company will from time to time 
promptly pay all taxes and charges that may be imposed upon the Company 
or the Warrant Agent in respect of the issuance or delivery of Ordinary 
Shares upon the exercise of Warrants, but the Company shall not be 
obligated to pay any transfer taxes in respect of the Warrants or such 
shares.</p>
    <p>8.2. <u>Resignation, Consolidation, or Merger of Warrant Agent</u>.</p>
        <p>8.2.1. <u>Appointment of Successor Warrant Agent</u>. The 
Warrant Agent, or any successor to it hereafter appointed, may resign 
its duties and be discharged from all further duties and liabilities 
hereunder after giving sixty (60) days’ notice in writing to the 
Company. If the office of the Warrant Agent becomes vacant by 
resignation or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company shall appoint
 in writing a successor Warrant Agent in place of the Warrant Agent. If 
the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 
thirty (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such 
resignation or incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the holder of the 
Warrant (who shall, with such notice, submit his Warrant for inspection 
by the Company), then the holder of any Warrant may apply to the Supreme
 Court of the State of New York for the County of New York for the 
appointment of a successor Warrant Agent at the Company’s cost. Any 
successor Warrant Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such 
court, shall be a corporation organized and existing under the laws of 
the State of New York, in good standing and having its principal office 
in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, and authorized 
under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to 
supervision or examination by federal or state authority. After 
appointment, any successor Warrant Agent shall be vested with all the 
authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties, and obligations of its 
predecessor Warrant Agent with like effect as if originally named as 
Warrant Agent hereunder, without any further act or deed; but if for any
 reason it becomes necessary or appropriate, the predecessor Warrant 
Agent shall execute and deliver, at the expense of the Company, an 
instrument transferring to such successor Warrant Agent all the 
authority, powers, and rights of such predecessor Warrant Agent 
hereunder; and upon request of any successor Warrant Agent the Company 
shall make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all instruments in
 writing for more fully and effectually vesting in and confirming to 
such successor Warrant Agent all such authority, powers, rights, 
immunities, duties, and obligations.</p>
        <p>8.2.2. <u>Notice of Successor Warrant Agent</u>. In the event
 a successor Warrant Agent shall be appointed, the Company shall give 
notice thereof to the predecessor Warrant Agent and the Transfer Agent 
for the Ordinary Shares not later than the effective date of any such 
appointment.</p>
        <p>8.2.3. <u>Merger or Consolidation of Warrant Agent</u>. Any 
corporation into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it 
may be consolidated or any corporation resulting from any merger or 
consolidation to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party shall be the 
successor Warrant Agent under this Agreement without any further act.</p>
    <p>8.3. <u>Fees and Expenses of Warrant Agent</u>.</p>
        <p>8.3.1. <u>Remuneration</u>. The Company agrees to pay the 
Warrant Agent reasonable remuneration for its services as such Warrant 
Agent hereunder and will reimburse the Warrant Agent upon demand for all
 expenditures that the Warrant Agent may reasonably incur in the 
execution of its duties hereunder.</p>
        <p>8.3.2. <u>Further Assurances</u>. The Company agrees to 
perform, execute, acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be performed, 
executed, acknowledged, and delivered all such further and other acts, 
instruments, and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Warrant
 Agent for the carrying out or performing of the provisions of this 
Agreement.</p>
    <p>8.4. <u>Liability of Warrant Agent</u>.</p>
        <p>8.4.1. <u>Reliance on Company Statement</u>. Whenever in the 
performance of its duties under this Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall 
deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or 
established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action 
hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof
 be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively 
proved and established by a statement signed by the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, President, 
Secretary or Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and 
delivered to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent may rely upon such 
statement for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it pursuant 
to the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>8.4.2. <u>Indemnity</u>. The Warrant Agent shall be liable 
hereunder only for its own fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct 
or bad faith. The Company agrees to indemnify the Warrant Agent and save
 it harmless against any and all liabilities, including judgments, costs
 and reasonable counsel fees, for anything done or omitted by the 
Warrant Agent in the execution of this Agreement except as a result of 
the Warrant Agent’s fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad 
faith.</p>
        <p>8.4.3. <u>Exclusions</u>. The Warrant Agent shall have no 
responsibility with respect to the validity of this Agreement or with 
respect to the validity or execution of any Warrant (except its 
countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by
 the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or
 in any Warrant; nor shall it be responsible to make any adjustments 
required under the provisions of <u>Section 4</u> hereof or responsible 
for the manner, method, or amount of any such adjustment or the 
ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such 
adjustment; nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any 
representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any
 Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Warrant 
or as to whether any Ordinary Shares will, when issued, be valid and 
fully paid and nonassessable.</p>
    <p>8.5. <u>Acceptance of Agency</u>. The Warrant Agent hereby 
accepts the agency established by this Agreement and agrees to perform 
the same upon the terms and conditions herein set forth and among other 
things, shall account promptly to the Company with respect to Warrants 
exercised and concurrently account for, and pay to the Company, all 
monies received by the Warrant Agent for the purchase of Ordinary Shares
 through the exercise of Warrants.</p>

<p>9. <u>Miscellaneous Provisions</u>.</p>
    <p>9.1. <u>Successors</u>. All the covenants and provisions of this 
Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company or the Warrant Agent 
shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and 
assigns.</p>
    <p>9.2. <u>Notices</u>. Any notice, statement or demand authorized 
by this Agreement to be given or made by the Warrant Agent or by the 
holder of any Warrant to or on the Company shall be sufficiently given 
when so delivered if by hand or overnight delivery or if sent by 
certified mail or private courier service within five (5) days after

    <p>Any notice, statement or demand authorized by this Agreement to

    Attn: Michael J. Blankenship</p>
    <p>9.3. <u>Applicable Law and Exclusive Forum</u>. The validity, 
interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and of the Warrants 
shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, 
without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result 
in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction. 
Subject to applicable law, the Company hereby agrees that any action, 
proceeding or claim against it arising out of or relating in any way to 
this Agreement, including under the Act, shall be brought and enforced 
in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District 
Court for the Southern District of New York, and irrevocably submits to 
such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be exclusive forum for any 
such action, proceeding or claim. The Company hereby waives any 
objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent 
an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of 
this paragraph will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability 
or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the 
federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and
 exclusive forum.</p>
    <p>Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any 
interest in the Warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have 
consented to the forum provisions in this <u>Section 9.3</u>. If any 
action, the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum 
provisions above, is filed in a court other than a court located within 
the State of New York or the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any 
warrant holder, such warrant holder shall be deemed to have consented 
to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts 
located within the State of New York or the United States District Court
 for the Southern District of New York in connection with any action 
brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an 
“enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such 
warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such 
warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant
 holder.</p>
    <p>9.4. <u>Persons Having Rights under this Agreement</u>. Nothing 
in this Agreement expressed and nothing that may be implied from any of 
the provisions hereof is intended, or shall be construed, to confer 
upon, or give to, any person or corporation other than the parties 
hereto and the registered holders of the Warrants any right, remedy, or 
claim under or by reason of this Agreement or of any covenant, 
condition, stipulation, promise, or agreement hereof. All covenants, 
conditions, stipulations, promises, and agreements contained in this 
Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties 
hereto and their successors and assigns and of the registered holders of
 the Warrants.</p>
    <p>9.5. <u>Examination of the Warrant Agreement</u>. A copy of this 
Agreement shall be available at all reasonable times at the office of 
the Warrant Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New 
York, for inspection by the registered holder of any Warrant. The 
Warrant Agent may require any such holder to submit his Warrant for 
inspection by it.</p>
    <p>9.6. <u>Counterparts</u>. This Agreement may be executed in any 
number of original or facsimile counterparts and each of such 
counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all
 such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same 
instrument.</p>
    <p>9.7. <u>Effect of Headings</u>. The section headings herein are 
for convenience only and are not part of this Agreement and shall not 
affect the interpretation thereof.</p>
    <p>9.8. <u>Amendments</u>. This Agreement may be amended by the 
parties hereto without the consent of any registered holder for the 
purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or to correct any mistake, including
 to conform the provisions hereof to the description of the terms of the
 Warrants and this Agreement set forth in the Prospectus, or curing, 
correcting or supplementing any defective provision contained herein, or
 (ii) adding or changing any other provisions with respect to matters or
 questions arising under this Agreement as the parties may deem 
necessary or desirable and that the parties deem shall not adversely 
affect the interest of the registered holders. All other modifications 
or amendments, including any amendment to increase the Warrant Price or 
shorten the Exercise Period, shall require the written consent or vote 
of the registered holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding
 Public Warrants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any amendment to 
the terms of the Private Placement Warrants shall only require the 
consent of the Company and the holders of a majority of the Private 
Placement Warrants and (b) the Company may lower the Warrant Price or 
extend the duration of the Exercise Period pursuant to <u>Sections 3.1</u> and <u>3.2</u>, respectively, without the consent of the registered holders.</p>
    <p>9.9. <u>Trust Account Waiver</u>. The Warrant Agent acknowledges 
and agrees that it shall not make any claims or proceed against the 
trust account established by the Company in connection with the Public 
Offering (as more fully described in the Registration Statement) (“<u>Trust Account</u>”),
 including by way of set-off, and shall not be entitled to any funds in 
the Trust Account under any circumstance. In the event that the Warrant 
Agent has a claim against the Company under this Agreement, the Warrant 
Agent will pursue such claim solely against the Company and not against 
the property held in the Trust Account.</p>
    <p>9.10. <u>Severability</u>. This Agreement shall be deemed 
severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or 
provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this
 Agreement or of any other term or provision hereof. Furthermore, in 
lieu of any such invalid or unenforceable term or provision, the parties
 hereto intend that there shall be added as a part of this Agreement a 
provision as similar in terms to such invalid or unenforceable provision
 as may be possible and be valid and enforceable.</p>
