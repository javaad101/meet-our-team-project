                                    <p>        
                                        On August 30, 2021, our initial shareholders paid $25,000 to cover certain of
                                        our offering costs in consideration for 1,150,000 founder shares. On November 
                                        15, 2021, we issued additional 1,006,250 Class B ordinary shares to the initial
                                        shareholders as founder shares for no additional consideration, resulting in our
                                        sponsor holding an aggregate of 2,156,250 founder shares (up to 281,250 of which
                                        are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the
                                        underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised). Our initial shareholders will collectively own 20% of our
                                        issued and outstanding shares after this offering (assuming our initial
                                        shareholders do not purchase any other units in this offering and excluding the
                                        private placement shares underlying the private placement units). If we increase
                                        or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a capitalization or share
                                        repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with
                                        respect to our founder shares immediately prior to the consummation of this
                                        offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of
                                        our issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon the consummation of this
                                        offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private
                                        placement units and any units they may purchase in this offering).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the
                                        founder shares (except to certain permitted transferees as described below)
                                        until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of our
                                        initial business combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our
                                        Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per Class A ordinary share (as
                                        adjusted for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations and
                                        recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading
                                        day period commencing six months after our initial business combination.

                                        Our sponsor has committed to purchase an aggregate of 465,000 (or 510,000 if the
                                        overallotment is exercised in full) insider units at $10.00 per insider unit for
                                        an aggregate purchase price of $4,650,000 (or $5,100,000 if the overallotment is
                                        exercised in full) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with
                                        the closing of this offering. Our sponsor (and/or its designees) has agreed not
                                        to transfer, assign or sell any of the shares included in the insider units and
                                        the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants included in the
                                        insider units until after the completion of our initial business combination.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Fortune Joy Capital Corp, our sponsor, agreed, from the date that our securities
                                        are first listed on the Nasdaq Global Market through the earlier of our
                                        consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation, to make
                                        available to us office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
                                        services through its affiliated business entities, as we may require from time
                                        to time at no cost to us.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Other than the executive compensation as disclosed in this registration
                                        statement and any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as
                                        identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
                                        business combinations, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder’s
                                        fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation, will be paid to our
                                        sponsor, officers or directors, or to any of their respective affiliates, prior
                                        to or with respect to our initial business combination (regardless of the type
                                        of transaction that it is). Our independent directors will review on a quarterly
                                        basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or
                                        their affiliates and will be responsible for reviewing and approving all
                                        transactions as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K, after reviewing each 
                                        such transaction for potential conflicts of interests and
                                        other improprieties.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $500,000 to be used for a portion of the
                                        expenses of this offering. This loan is noninterest bearing, unsecured and is
                                        due at the closing of this offering or the date on which the Company determines
                                        not to conduct the Proposed Public Offering. The loan will be repaid upon the
                                        closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust
                                        account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with
                                        an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
                                        sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
                                        funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
                                        would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
                                        combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
                                        outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
                                        trust account would be used for such repayment. Such loans would be evidenced by
                                        promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our
                                        initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion.
                                        Up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business
                                        combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After our initial business combination, members of our management team who
                                        remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the
                                        combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our
                                        shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy
                                        solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is
                                        unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of
                                        distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting of our shareholders
                                        held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be
                                        up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        All ongoing and future transactions between us and any member of our management
                                        team or his or her respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us at that
                                        time, based upon other similar arrangements known to us, to be no less favorable
                                        to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. It is our intention to
                                        obtain estimates from unaffiliated third parties for similar goods or services
                                        to ascertain whether such transactions with affiliates are on terms that are no
                                        less favorable to us than are otherwise available from such unaffiliated third
                                        parties. If a transaction with an affiliated third party were found to be on
                                        terms less favorable to us than with an unaffiliated third party, we would not
                                        engage in such transaction.
                                    </p>

                                        We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a
                                        company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event
                                        we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is
                                        affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of
                                        independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment
                                        banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our shareholders
                                        from a financial point of view.
                                    </p>

                                        We have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder
                                        shares, insider units and any securities issued upon conversion of working
                                        capital loans, among others, as discussed in detail in this Prospectus.
