                                        due at the closing of this offering or the date on which the Company determines
                                        not to conduct the Proposed Public Offering. The loan will be repaid upon the

                                        would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
                                        combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
                                        outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
                                        trust account would be used for such repayment. Such loans would be evidenced by
                                        promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our
                                        initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion.
                                        Up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business
                                        combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit.
