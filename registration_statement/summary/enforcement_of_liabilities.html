                    We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted
                    company. The Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as
                    compared to the United States and provides less protection to investors.
                    Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before
                    the federal courts of the United States.

                    We have been advised by Maples and Calder (Hong Kong) LLP, our Cayman
                    Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely
                    (1) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United
                    States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal
                    securities laws of the United States or any state and (2) in original
                    actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us
                    predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities
                    laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by
                    those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there
                    is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in
                    the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and
                    enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent
                    jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a
                    judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an
                    obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain
                    conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman
                    Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated
                    sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent
                    with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on
                    the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the
                    enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of
                    the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held
                    to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay
                    enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought
                    elsewhere.

                    Our management team consists of two members who are located outside of the
                    United States. Long Chen, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the
                    Board, and Xingyun (Tracy) Xu, our Chief Financial Officer and Director,
                    reside in China, are citizens of China and their assets are located outside
                    of the United States. There is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the
                    Cayman Islands or China would (i) recognize or enforce judgments of United
                    States courts obtained against our directors or officers outside of the
                    United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
                    securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States or
                    (ii) entertain original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or China
                    against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws
                    of the United States or any state in the United States. Recognition and
                    enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under China’s Civil
                    Procedure Law. China’s courts may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in
                    accordance with the requirements of the Civil Procedure Law based either on
                    treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on
                    reciprocity between jurisdictions. There are no treaties between China and
                    the United States for the mutual recognition and enforcement of court
                    judgments, thus making the recognition and enforcement of a U.S. court
                    judgment in China difficult.
