                In addition, our sponsor has committed that it will purchase from us an
                aggregate of 465,000 private placement units at $10.00 per unit for a total
                purchase price of $4,650,000 in a private placement that will occur
                simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsor has also

                from us additional private placement units on a pro rata basis (up to a maximum
                of 45,000 additional private placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit) in
                an amount that is necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.20 per unit
                sold to the public in this offering. These additional private placement units
                will be purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the

                offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in this prospectus.

                completion window, the proceeds from the sale of the private placement units
                will be included in the liquidating distribution to our public shareholders and
                the private placement units will be worthless.
