                We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination
                at a general meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to
                convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the
                proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of
                the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes
                payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their
                shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a
                shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate
                amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case
                subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will
                seek shareholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow
                shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us,
                solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the
                timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would
                otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we decide to allow
                shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we will file tender
                offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial
                and other information about the initial business combination as is required
                under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination
                only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately
                prior to or upon such consummation and, if we seek shareholder approval, we
                obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which
                requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and
                vote at a general meeting of the company.

                We will have 12 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an
                initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able
                to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, our insiders or
                their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to
                consummate a business combination up to six times by an additional one month
                each time for a total of up to 18

                months (the “Paid Extension Period”). In the case of the Paid Extension Period,
                public shareholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem
                their shares if we choose to make any such paid extension. However, our
                shareholders will be entitled to vote and redeem their shares in connection with
                a general meeting held to approve an initial business combination or in a tender
                offer undertaken in connection with such an initial business combination if we
                propose such a business combination during any three

                Transfer &amp; Trust Company and us on the date of this prospectus, in order for
                the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be

                If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time
                period, we will redeem 100% of our issued and outstanding public shares for a
                pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate
                amount, then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the
                funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our
                taxes (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), divided by
                the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to applicable
                law and as further described herein, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. We
                expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.20 per Class A

                we cannot assure you that we will, in fact, be able to distribute such amounts
                as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of
                our public shareholders.

                Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we
                acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the
                balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income
                earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive
                agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be
                required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test. The fair market value
                of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or
                more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and
                potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation
                materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed
                transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of the fair
                market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our
                determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the
                target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion
                from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another
                independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the
                satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any
                initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent
                directors.

                We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of
                the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may,
                however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with
                the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or
                assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target
                management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete
                such business combination if the post

                company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the
                target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for
                it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment
                Company Act. Even if the post

                company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our
                shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority
                interest in the post

                company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business
                combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we
                issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
                capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we
                could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of
                the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately
                prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our
                issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If
                less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or
                businesses are owned or acquired by the post
                <font class="nobreak">
                    -transaction

                company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is
                what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.
