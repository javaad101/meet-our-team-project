                We are a newly formed blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands
                exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset
                acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with
                one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our
                initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to
                organizational activities and activities related to this offering. We have not
                selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
                behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any
                target business regarding entering into a business combination with us.

                Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to
                a particular industry or geographic location except that according to our
                amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not
                effectuate an initial Business Combination with a company that is headquartered
                in the People’s Republic of China (“China”), the Hong Kong Special
                Administrative Region of China (“Hong Kong”) or the Macau Special Administrative
                Region of China (“Macau”) or conducts a majority of its operations in China,
                Hong Kong or Macau. We intend to focus on businesses in fast

                add value to these businesses primarily by providing them with access to the
                U.S. capital markets. However, given that our management team is located in
                China and is not able to target China businesses (including Hong and Macau), it
                might make it more difficult for us to find target companies outside of China,
                and it might make us a less attractive business combination partner for target
                businesses.

                We will seek to capitalize on the strength of our management team. Our team
                consists of experienced entrepreneurs, financial services and accounting
                professionals, senior operating executives, and managers of Asian and
                U.S. companies. We believe we will benefit from their accomplishments, and
                specifically their current activities in the Asian and U.S. markets, in
                identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. However, the past performance
                of our management team, advisors and their affiliates is not a guarantee either
                of (i) success of any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we
                will complete a business combination.
