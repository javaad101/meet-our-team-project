  <P>6. <U>RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY</U></P>
  <ol>
    <li><I>Definitions.</I></li>
  </ol>
  <P>A &ldquo;Related Party Transaction&rdquo; is any transaction directly or indirectly involving any Related Party
    that would need to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Under Item 404(a), the Company is required to
    disclose any transaction occurring since the beginning of the Company&rsquo;s last fiscal year, or any currently
    proposed transaction, involving the Company where the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related
    person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. &ldquo;Related Party Transaction&rdquo; also
    includes any material amendment or modification to an existing Related Party Transaction.</P>
  <P>&ldquo;Related Party&rdquo; means any of the following:</P>
  <ul>
    <li>a director (which term when used herein includes any director nominee);</li>
    <li>an executive officer;</li>
    <li>a person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company&rsquo;s common stock (a
      &ldquo;5% shareholder&rdquo;); or</li>
    <li>a person known by the Company to be an immediate family member of any of the foregoing.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <P>&ldquo;Immediate family member&rdquo; means a child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-
    law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of such director, executive
    officer, nominee for director or beneficial owner, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the
    household of such director, executive officer, nominee for director or beneficial owner.</P>

  <ol start="2">
    <li><I>Identification of Potential Related Party Transactions.</I></li>
  </ol>
  <P>Related Party Transactions will be brought to management&rsquo;s and the Board&rsquo;s attention in a number of
    ways. Each of the Company&rsquo;s directors and executive officers shall inform the Chairman of the Committee of any
    potential Related Party Transactions. In addition, each such director and executive officer shall complete a
    questionnaire on an annual basis designed to elicit information about any potential Related Party Transactions.</P>
  <P>Any potential Related Party Transactions that are brought to the Committee&rsquo;s attention shall be analyzed by
    the Committee, in consultation with outside counsel or members of management, as appropriate, to determine whether
    the transaction or relationship does, in fact, constitute a Related Party Transaction requiring compliance with this
    Policy.</P>

  <ol start="3">
    <li><I>Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions.</I></li>
  </ol>
  <P>At each of its meetings, the Committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing or proposed Related
    Party Transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the Company has already
    committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits to the Company and to the relevant Related
    Party. In determining whether to approve a Related Party Transaction, the Committee shall consider, among other
    factors, the following factors to the extent relevant to the Related Party Transaction:</P>
  <ul>
    <li>whether the terms of the Related Party Transaction are fair to the Company and on the same basis as would apply
      if the transaction did not involve a Related Party;</li>
    <li>whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the Related Party Transaction;</li>
    <li>whether the Related Party Transaction would impair the independence of an outside director;</li>
    <li>whether the Related Party Transaction would present an improper conflict of interests for any director or
      executive officer of the Company, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position
      of the director, executive officer or Related Party, the direct or indirect nature of the director&rsquo;s,
      executive officer&rsquo;s or Related Party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any
      proposed relationship, and any other factors the Committee deems relevant; and</li>
    <li>any pre-existing contractual obligations.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <P>Any member of the Committee who has an interest in the transaction under discussion shall abstain from voting on
    the approval of the Related Party Transaction, but may, if so requested by the Chairman of the Committee,
    participate in some or all of the Committee&rsquo;s discussions of the Related Party Transaction. Upon completion of
    its review of the transaction, the Committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the Related Party Transaction.
  </P>
  <P>A Related Party Transaction entered into without pre-approval of the Committee shall not be deemed to violate this
    Policy, or be invalid or unenforceable, so long as the transaction is brought to the Committee as promptly as
    reasonably practical after it is entered into or after it becomes reasonably apparent that the transaction is
    covered by this Policy.</P>
  <P>A Related Party Transaction entered into prior to the effective date of this Charter shall not be required to be
    reapproved by the Committee.</P>

  <P>7. <U>DISCLOSURE</U>. If required by the rules of the SEC or any of any exchange or national listing market system
    upon which the Company&rsquo;s securities are listed or quoted for trading, this Charter, as amended from time to
    time, shall be made available to the public on the Company&rsquo;s website or filed with the SEC.</P>
