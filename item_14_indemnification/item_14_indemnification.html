                                        Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and
                                        articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and
                                        directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman
                                        Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide
                                        indemnification against willful default, civil fraud or the consequences of
                                        committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
                                        association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to
                                        the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in
                                        their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud or willful
                                        default. We may purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability
                                        insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense,
                                        settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against
                                        our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.

                                        Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may
                                        be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the
                                        foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such
                                        indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
                                        is therefore unenforceable.
