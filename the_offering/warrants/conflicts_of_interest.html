						Each of our officers and directors presently has, and in the
						future any of our directors and our officers may have
						additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other
						entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will
						be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity.
						Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman
						Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware
						of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to
						which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual
						obligations, he or she may need to honor his or her fiduciary or
						contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity
						to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects
						the opportunity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under
						Cayman Islands law. Our amended and restated memorandum and
						articles of association will provide that, subject to his or
						herÂ fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, we renounce our
						interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or
						director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such
						person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of
						our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and
						contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be
						reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that
						any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors
						or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete
						our business combination.
